The abstract
problem abstract
of abstract
collecting abstract
responses abstract
in abstract
multi-hop abstract
radio abstract
networks abstract
is abstract
considered. abstract
A abstract
given abstract
node, abstract
called abstract
the abstract
source, abstract
is abstract
to abstract
collect abstract
a abstract
specified abstract
number abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
responses abstract
from abstract
nodes abstract
in abstract
a abstract
radio abstract
network. abstract
The abstract
problem abstract
arises abstract
in abstract
several abstract
+L+ other
applications abstract
of abstract
distributed abstract
systems. abstract
A abstract
deterministic abstract
and abstract
a abstract
randomized abstract
protocol abstract
for abstract
the abstract
problem abstract
are abstract
presented. abstract
The abstract
two abstract
protocols abstract
are abstract
analyzed abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
their abstract
performance abstract
is abstract
compared. abstract
Conclusions abstract
are abstract
drawn abstract
about abstract
the abstract
suitability abstract

of abstract
our abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
1972, abstract
Reynolds abstract
outlined abstract
a abstract
general abstract
method abstract
for abstract
eliminating abstract
functional abstract
arguments abstract
known abstract
as abstract
defunctionalization. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
idea abstract
underlying abstract
defunctionalization abstract
is abstract
encoding abstract
functional abstract
+L+ other
values abstract
as abstract
first-order abstract
data, abstract
and abstract
then abstract
to abstract
realized abstract
the abstract
applications abstract
of abstract
the abstract
encoded abstract
function abstract
via abstract
an abstract
apply abstract
function. abstract
Although abstract
this abstract
process abstract
is abstract
simple abstract
enough, abstract
problems abstract
arise abstract
when abstract
+L+ other
defunctionalization abstract
is abstract
used abstract
in abstract
a abstract
polymorphic abstract
language. abstract
In abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
a abstract
language, abstract
a abstract
functional abstract
argument abstract
of abstract
a abstract
higher-order abstract
+L+ other
function abstract
can abstract
take abstract
different abstract
type abstract
instances abstract
in abstract
different abstract
applications. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
consequence, abstract
its abstract
associated abstract
apply abstract
function abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
untypable abstract
in abstract
the abstract
soucre abstract
language. abstract
In abstract
the abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
present abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
defunctionalization abstract
transformation abstract
which abstract
preserves abstract
typa-bility. abstract
Moreover, abstract
the abstract
transformation abstract
imposes abstract
no abstract
restriction abstract
+L+ other
on abstract
functional abstract
arguments abstract
of abstract
recursive abstract
functions, abstract
and abstract
it abstract
handles abstract
functions abstract
as abstract
results abstract
as abstract
well abstract
as abstract
functions abstract
encapsulated abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
constructors abstract
or abstract
tuples. abstract
The abstract
key abstract
to abstract
this abstract
success abstract
is abstract
the abstract
use abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
type abstract
information abstract
in abstract
the abstract
defunctionalization abstract
transformation. abstract
Run-time abstract
characteristics abstract
are abstract
preserved abstract
by abstract
defunction-alization; abstract
hence, abstract
there abstract
is abstract
no abstract
performance abstract
improvement abstract
coming abstract
from abstract
the abstract
transformation abstract
itself. abstract
However abstract
closures abstract
need abstract
+L+ other
not abstract
be abstract
implemented abstract
to abstract
compile abstract
the abstract
transformed abstract
program. abstract
+L+ other
Since abstract
the abstract
defunctionalization abstract
is abstract
driven abstract
by abstract
type abstract
information, abstract
+L+ other
it abstract
can abstract
also abstract
easily abstract
perform abstract
a abstract
specialization abstract
of abstract
higher-order abstract
+L+ other
functions abstract
with abstract
respect abstract
to abstract
the abstract
values abstract
of abstract
their abstract
functional abstract
arguments, abstract
hence abstract
gaining abstract
a abstract

We abstract

Our abstract

Therefore, abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
describes abstract
several abstract
of abstract
our abstract
experiences abstract
with abstract
a abstract
real-time abstract
scheduler. abstract
Using abstract
a abstract
robot abstract
control abstract
application abstract
program, abstract
we abstract
motivate abstract
the abstract
importance abstract
of abstract
supporting abstract
multiple abstract
schedulers abstract
within abstract
the abstract
same abstract
application abstract
+L+ other
program. abstract
We abstract
demonstrate abstract
the abstract
utility abstract
of abstract
speculative abstract
task abstract
execution abstract
in abstract
dynamic abstract
real-time abstract
systems, abstract
and abstract
describe abstract
the abstract
implementation abstract
of abstract
a abstract
scheduler abstract
for abstract
performing abstract
speculative abstract
execution abstract
and abstract
recovery. abstract
We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
existing abstract
real-time abstract
scheduler abstract
interfaces abstract
have abstract
scope abstract
for abstract
improvement, abstract
especially abstract
when abstract
scheduling abstract
latency abstract
must abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
low abstract
and abstract
when abstract
multiple abstract
schedulers abstract
used abstract
by abstract
a abstract
single abstract
application abstract
must abstract
co-exist abstract
on abstract
a abstract
single abstract
processor. abstract
A abstract
new abstract
+L+ other
scheduler abstract
interface abstract
is abstract
specified abstract
and abstract
its abstract
basic abstract
costs abstract
are abstract
evaluated abstract
experimentally. abstract
Preliminary abstract
measurements abstract
on abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
KSR-1 abstract
machine abstract
are abstract
quoted. abstract
The abstract
measurements abstract
demonstrate abstract
how abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
times abstract
of abstract
temporal abstract
queries abstract
+L+ other
may abstract
be abstract
reduced abstract
by abstract
use abstract
of abstract
access abstract
structures abstract
to abstract
scheduler abstract
data abstract
structures. abstract
Finally, abstract
there abstract
are abstract
several abstract
overheads abstract
+L+ other

Multicast abstract
routing abstract
is abstract
an abstract
important abstract
topic abstract
of abstract
both abstract
theoretical abstract

+L+ other
interest. abstract
Some abstract

The abstract

In abstract

we abstract

investigate abstract
the abstract

the abstract

Specifically, abstract
we abstract

We abstract
+L+ other
conclude abstract
that abstract
simple abstract

are abstract
adequate abstract
for abstract
widely abstract

that abstract
the abstract

when abstract
the abstract

We abstract
also abstract

Abstract. abstract
A abstract
critical abstract
challenge abstract
faced abstract
by abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
of abstract
a abstract
software abstract
system abstract
is abstract
to abstract
understand abstract
whether abstract
the abstract
system's abstract
components abstract
correctly abstract
integrate. abstract
While abstract
type abstract
theory abstract
has abstract
provided abstract
substantial abstract
help abstract
in abstract
detecting abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
preventing abstract
errors abstract
in abstract
mismatched abstract
static abstract
properties, abstract
much abstract
work abstract
remains abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
the abstract
area abstract
of abstract
dynamics. abstract
In abstract
particular, abstract
components abstract
make abstract
assumptions abstract
+L+ other
about abstract
their abstract
behavioral abstract
interaction abstract
with abstract
other abstract
components, abstract
but abstract
currently abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
have abstract
only abstract
limited abstract
ways abstract
in abstract
which abstract
to abstract
state abstract
those abstract
assumptions abstract
and abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
analyze abstract
those abstract
assumptions abstract
for abstract
correctness. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
have abstract
begun abstract
to abstract
formulate abstract
a abstract
method abstract
that abstract
addresses abstract
this abstract
problem. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
operates abstract
at abstract
the abstract
architectural abstract
level abstract
so abstract
that abstract
behavioral abstract
integration abstract
+L+ other
errors, abstract
such abstract
as abstract
deadlock, abstract
can abstract
be abstract
revealed abstract
early abstract
in abstract
development. abstract
For abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
component, abstract
a abstract
specification abstract
is abstract
given abstract
both abstract
of abstract
its abstract
own abstract
interaction abstract
behavior abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
of abstract
the abstract
assumptions abstract
that abstract
it abstract
makes abstract
about abstract
the abstract
interaction abstract
behavior abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
external abstract
context abstract
in abstract
which abstract
it abstract
expects abstract
to abstract
operate. abstract
We abstract
have abstract
defined abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
that, abstract
given abstract
such abstract
specifications abstract
for abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
components, abstract
performs abstract
"adequacy" abstract
checks abstract
between abstract
the abstract
component abstract
context abstract
assumptions abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
the abstract

behaviors. abstract
A abstract

if abstract
a abstract

can abstract
be abstract
found. abstract
In abstract

we abstract
are abstract

Data- abstract

two abstract

Object-oriented abstract

+L+ other
in abstract
parallelism abstract
provides abstract
a abstract
good abstract
way abstract
of abstract
abstracting abstract
out abstract
various abstract
aspects abstract
of abstract
computations abstract
and abstract
computing abstract
resources. abstract
Using abstract
an abstract
object-oriented abstract
language abstract
like abstract
C++, abstract
one abstract
can abstract
compose abstract
data abstract
and abstract
control abstract
representations abstract
+L+ other
into abstract
a abstract
single abstract

+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
thread abstract
model abstract

parallelism abstract
that abstract
addresses abstract
both abstract
data abstract

task abstract
parallelism. abstract
Computation abstract
+L+ other
and abstract

be abstract
overlapped abstract
by abstract
suspending abstract
a abstract
thread abstract

running abstract
an abstract
eligible abstract
thread abstract
of abstract
computation abstract

place. abstract
Threads abstract
naturally abstract
subsume abstract
task-parallelism. abstract
Threads abstract
are abstract
encapsulated abstract
into abstract
thread abstract
objects abstract
may abstract
be abstract
grouped abstract

rope abstract

[22, abstract

that abstract
+L+ other
span abstract
the abstract

machine abstract
domain, abstract
for abstract
collective abstract

communication. abstract
Thus abstract
data-parallelism abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
supported. abstract
Since abstract
rope abstract
objects abstract
are abstract
parallel abstract
objects, abstract
they abstract
can abstract
be abstract
customized, abstract
interestingly, abstract

While abstract

Several abstract

the abstract
combination abstract

we abstract
refer abstract

as abstract
an abstract
option. abstract
Value abstract

and abstract

can abstract
be abstract
learned abstract

methods abstract
designed abstract
+L+ other
for abstract
semi-Markov abstract

+L+ other
However, abstract
all abstract
these abstract

require abstract
an abstract

+L+ other
be abstract
executed abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
explore abstract
methods abstract
that abstract

that abstract
option, abstract
even abstract

the abstract

itself abstract

We abstract
call abstract
these abstract
methods abstract
intra-option abstract
learning abstract
methods abstract
because abstract
they abstract
learn abstract

+L+ other
within abstract

Intra-option abstract

are abstract
sometimes abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
hybrid abstract
method abstract
for abstract
synthesis abstract
of abstract
hierarchical abstract
structured abstract
Petri abstract
nets. abstract
In abstract
a abstract
top-down abstract
manner, abstract
we abstract
decompose abstract
a abstract
system abstract
into abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
subsystems abstract
at abstract
each abstract
level abstract
of abstract
abstraction, abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
these abstract
is abstract
specified abstract
as abstract
a abstract
blackbox abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
that abstract
has abstract
multiple abstract
inputs abstract
and abstract
outputs. abstract
We abstract
stipulate abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
each abstract
subsystem abstract
satisfies abstract
the abstract
following abstract
I/O abstract
constraints: abstract
(1) abstract
At abstract
any abstract
instance abstract
of abstract
time, abstract
at abstract
+L+ other
most abstract
one abstract
of abstract
the abstract
inputs abstract
can abstract
be abstract
activated; abstract
and abstract
(2) abstract
If abstract
one abstract
input abstract
is abstract
activated, abstract
then abstract
the abstract
subsystem abstract
+L+ other
must abstract
consume abstract
the abstract
input abstract
and abstract
produce abstract
exactly abstract
one abstract
output abstract
within abstract
a abstract
finite abstract
length abstract
of abstract
time. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
give abstract
a abstract
stepwise abstract
refinement abstract
procedure abstract
which abstract
starts abstract
from abstract
the abstract
initial abstract
high-level abstract
abstraction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
and abstract
expands abstract
an abstract
internal abstract
place abstract
of abstract
a abstract
blackbox abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
into abstract
a abstract
more abstract
detailed abstract
subnet abstract
at abstract
+L+ other
each abstract
step. abstract
By abstract
enforcing abstract
the abstract
I/O abstract
constraints abstract
of abstract
each abstract
subsystem abstract
in abstract
each abstract
intermediate abstract
abstraction, abstract
+L+ other
our abstract
refinement abstract
maintains abstract
the abstract
sequencing abstract
of abstract
transitions abstract
prescribed abstract
by abstract
the abstract
initial abstract
abstraction abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
system. abstract
Next, abstract
for abstract
the abstract
bottom-up abstract
synthesis, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
interconnection abstract
rules abstract
for abstract
sequential, abstract
+L+ other
parallel, abstract
and abstract
loop abstract
structures abstract
and abstract
prove abstract
that abstract
each abstract
rule abstract
maintains abstract
the abstract
I/O abstract
constraints. abstract
Thus, abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
incorporating abstract
these abstract
interconnection abstract
rules abstract
into abstract
our abstract
refinement abstract
formulation, abstract
our abstract
approach abstract
can abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
regarded abstract
as abstract
a abstract
hybrid abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
synthesis abstract
technique abstract
that abstract
employs abstract
both abstract
top-down abstract
and abstract
bottom-up abstract
+L+ other

We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
bandwidth abstract
allocation abstract
scheme abstract
for abstract
VBR abstract
video abstract
traffic abstract
in abstract
ATM abstract
networks. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
scheme abstract
is abstract
tailored abstract
to abstract
MPEG-coded abstract
video abstract
sources abstract
that abstract
require abstract
stringent abstract
and abstract
deterministic abstract
+L+ other
quality-of-service abstract
guarantees. abstract
By abstract
exploiting abstract
the abstract
temporal abstract
structure abstract
of abstract
MPEG abstract
sources, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
our abstract
scheme abstract
results abstract
in abstract
an abstract
effective abstract
bandwidth abstract
which, abstract
in abstract
most abstract
cases, abstract
is abstract
less abstract
than abstract
the abstract
source abstract
+L+ other
peak abstract
rate. abstract
The abstract
reduction abstract
in abstract
the abstract
bandwidth abstract
requirement abstract
is abstract
achieved abstract
without abstract
sacrificing abstract
any abstract
+L+ other
perceived abstract
QoS. abstract
Efficient abstract
procedures abstract
are abstract
provided abstract
for abstract
the abstract
computation abstract
of abstract
the abstract
effective abstract
bandwidth abstract
+L+ other
under abstract
heterogeneous abstract
MPEG abstract
sources. abstract
The abstract
effective abstract
bandwidth abstract
strongly abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
the abstract
arrangement abstract
of abstract
the abstract
multiplexed abstract
streams abstract
which abstract
is abstract
a abstract
measure abstract
of abstract
the abstract
degree abstract
of abstract
synchronization abstract
between abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
GOP abstract
patterns abstract
of abstract
different abstract
streams. abstract
Assuming abstract
that abstract
all abstract
possible abstract
arrangements abstract
are abstract
equi-probable, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
derive abstract
an abstract
expression abstract
for abstract
the abstract
asymptotic abstract
tail abstract
distribution abstract
of abstract
the abstract
effective abstract
bandwidth. abstract
From abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
tail abstract
distribution, abstract
we abstract
compute abstract
several abstract
performance abstract
measures abstract
for abstract
the abstract
call abstract
blocking abstract
probability abstract
+L+ other
when abstract
the abstract
allocation abstract
is abstract
made abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
effective abstract
bandwidth. abstract
In abstract
the abstract
case abstract
of abstract
homogeneous abstract
+L+ other
sources, abstract
we abstract
give abstract
a abstract
closed-form abstract
expression abstract
for abstract
the abstract
`best' abstract
arrangement abstract
that abstract
results abstract
in abstract
the abstract
`optimal' abstract
+L+ other

Numerical abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
considers abstract
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
+L+ other
within abstract
hard abstract
real-time abstract
systems. abstract
As abstract
the abstract
name abstract
suggests, abstract
+L+ other
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
are abstract
distinguished abstract
by abstract
the abstract
fact abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
they abstract
are abstract
not abstract
locked. abstract
As abstract
such, abstract
they abstract
do abstract
not abstract
give abstract
+L+ other
rise abstract
to abstract
priority abstract
inversions, abstract
a abstract
key abstract
advantage abstract
over abstract
conventional, abstract
lock-based abstract
object-sharing abstract
approaches. abstract
Despite abstract
this abstract
advantage, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
not abstract
immediately abstract
apparent abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
can abstract
be abstract
employed abstract
if abstract
tasks abstract
+L+ other
must abstract
adhere abstract
to abstract
strict abstract
timing abstract
constraints. abstract
In abstract
particular, abstract
+L+ other
lock-free abstract
object abstract
implementations abstract
permit abstract
concurrent abstract
operations abstract
to abstract
interfere abstract
with abstract
each abstract
other, abstract
and abstract
repeated abstract
interferences abstract
can abstract
cause abstract
a abstract
given abstract
operation abstract
to abstract
take abstract
an abstract
arbitrarily abstract
long abstract
time abstract
to abstract
complete. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
main abstract
contribution abstract
of abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
is abstract
to abstract
show abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
interferences abstract
can abstract
be abstract
bounded abstract
by abstract
judicious abstract
scheduling. abstract
This abstract
work abstract
pertains abstract
to abstract
periodic, abstract

real-time abstract
+L+ other
tasks abstract
that abstract
share abstract
lock-free abstract
objects abstract

a abstract

In abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
first abstract

the abstract
paper, abstract
scheduling abstract
conditions abstract
are abstract
derived abstract
for abstract
such abstract
tasks, abstract
for abstract
both abstract
static abstract
and abstract
dynamic abstract
priority abstract
schemes. abstract
Based abstract
on abstract
these abstract
conditions, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
formally abstract
+L+ other
shown abstract
that abstract
lock-free abstract
object-sharing abstract
approaches abstract
can abstract
be abstract

We abstract

For abstract

Past abstract

have abstract
usually abstract

+L+ other
explanation-based abstract

(EBL) abstract
to abstract
generate abstract

Unfortunately, abstract

This abstract

In abstract
our abstract

Scope, abstract
EBL abstract

used abstract

The abstract

two abstract

more abstract

Future abstract

First, abstract

in abstract
+L+ other
which abstract

We abstract
present abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
recovering abstract
surface abstract
shape abstract
from abstract
the abstract
occluding abstract

using abstract
an abstract
active abstract
(i.e., abstract

It abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract
relation abstract
between abstract

+L+ other
a abstract

(i.e., abstract

at abstract

+L+ other
Unlike abstract
previous abstract
approaches abstract
for abstract
recovering abstract
shape abstract

the abstract

we abstract
use abstract
an abstract

that abstract

We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
there abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
a abstract
simple abstract

that abstract
allows abstract

This abstract
strategy abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
only abstract

therefore abstract
+L+ other
demonstrates abstract
that abstract

In abstract
the abstract

Besides, abstract
the abstract

The abstract

The abstract

considered. abstract
Three abstract

which abstract
gives abstract
strict abstract
+L+ other
priority abstract
to abstract
one abstract
class abstract

traffic, abstract
a abstract
threshold-based abstract

which abstract
priority abstract
is abstract
given abstract

one abstract

traffic abstract
when abstract
the abstract

some abstract

a abstract
+L+ other
"balancing" abstract

the abstract

Here, abstract
the abstract

The abstract
novel abstract
aspect abstract
of abstract
the abstract
technique abstract
is abstract
its abstract
ability abstract
to abstract
reduce abstract

in abstract
reliable abstract
+L+ other
multicast abstract

by abstract

repairs abstract

(i.e., abstract

The abstract
technique abstract
requires abstract

and abstract
no abstract

active abstract

beyond abstract
what abstract
is abstract
required abstract
by abstract
the abstract
current abstract
+L+ other
multicast abstract

model. abstract
Furthermore, abstract
the abstract
technique abstract
uses abstract
only abstract
end-to-end abstract
mechanisms, abstract
where abstract
all abstract
data abstract
and abstract
repairs abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
transmitted abstract
by abstract
the abstract
data-originating abstract

leaving abstract

We abstract
simulate abstract

a abstract
simple abstract

this abstract
technique abstract
to abstract
show abstract

We abstract
show abstract
how abstract
a abstract
protocol abstract
using abstract
the abstract

can abstract
be abstract

Finally, abstract
we abstract

several abstract

One abstract
such abstract

processor-cache abstract

In abstract

Specifically, abstract

the abstract

the abstract

technique abstract
1) abstract
when abstract

2) abstract
when abstract

3) abstract

4) abstract

the abstract

We abstract

ABSTRACT abstract
+L+ other
Communication abstract
in abstract
real-time abstract
systems abstract
has abstract
to abstract
be abstract
predictable, abstract
because abstract
unpredictable abstract
delays abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
delivery abstract
of abstract
messages abstract
can abstract
adversely abstract
affect abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
of abstract
tasks abstract
dependent abstract
on abstract
these abstract
messages. abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
develop abstract
a abstract
scheme abstract
for abstract
providing abstract
predictable abstract
inter-process abstract
communication abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
real-time abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
(partially abstract
connected) abstract
point-to-point abstract
interconnection abstract
networks, abstract
which abstract
+L+ other
provides abstract
guarantees abstract
on abstract
the abstract
maximum abstract
delivery abstract
time abstract
for abstract
messages. abstract
This abstract
scheme abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
concept abstract
of abstract
a abstract
real-time abstract
channel, abstract
a abstract
unidirectional abstract
connection abstract
between abstract
source abstract
and abstract
destination. abstract
A abstract
+L+ other
real-time abstract
channel abstract
has abstract
parameters abstract
which abstract
describe abstract
the abstract
performance abstract
requirements abstract
of abstract
the abstract
source-destination abstract
communication, abstract
e.g., abstract
from abstract
a abstract
sensor abstract
station abstract
to abstract
a abstract
control abstract
site. abstract
Once abstract
such abstract
a abstract
channel abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
established, abstract
the abstract
communications abstract
subsystem abstract
guarantees abstract
that abstract
these abstract
performance abstract
requirements abstract
+L+ other
will abstract
be abstract
met. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
concentrate abstract
on abstract
methods abstract
to abstract
compute abstract
guarantees abstract
for abstract
the abstract
delivery abstract
time abstract
of abstract
messages abstract
belonging abstract
to abstract
real-time abstract
channels. abstract
We abstract
also abstract
address abstract
problems abstract
associated abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
allocating abstract
buffers abstract
for abstract
these abstract
messages abstract
and abstract
develop abstract
a abstract
scheme abstract

preserves abstract

For abstract

Transformation abstract

Especially abstract
error-prone abstract
+L+ other
are abstract

The abstract

a abstract

typically abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
the abstract
syntax abstract

a abstract

rather abstract

in abstract

an abstract

makes abstract
effectiveness abstract

The abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
a abstract
transformation abstract
for abstract
object abstract
queries abstract
may abstract
depend abstract
on abstract
the abstract
semantics abstract
of abstract

functions, abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
may abstract
vary abstract
from abstract

to abstract
object abstract

Therefore, abstract
optimizers abstract
may abstract
have abstract
to abstract
perform abstract
+L+ other
sophisticated abstract
reasoning abstract
and abstract
apply abstract
transformations abstract
on abstract
a abstract
per abstract

This abstract
thesis abstract
considers abstract
the abstract
correctness abstract

of abstract
optimizer abstract

To abstract

we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract

we abstract

This abstract

We abstract

the abstract

Our abstract

organized abstract

three abstract

phases: abstract
analyzing abstract
array abstract
references, abstract
allocating abstract
the abstract
computation abstract
and abstract
data abstract
to abstract
the abstract

optimize abstract

An abstract
optimizing abstract
compiler abstract
for abstract
scalable abstract
parallel abstract
machines abstract
requires abstract
more abstract
sophisticated abstract
program abstract
analysis abstract
than abstract
the abstract
traditional abstract
data abstract

Our abstract
compiler abstract
uses abstract
a abstract

identify abstract

In abstract
order abstract
to abstract
allocate abstract
the abstract

the abstract
processors, abstract
the abstract
compiler abstract
+L+ other
first abstract
transforms abstract
the abstract

expose abstract
loop-level abstract

the abstract

It abstract
then abstract

such abstract
that abstract
parallelism abstract
is abstract

the abstract

The abstract
compiler abstract
will abstract
trade abstract
off abstract
extra abstract
degrees abstract

parallelism abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
reduce abstract
or abstract
eliminate abstract
communication. abstract
Finally, abstract
the abstract

generates abstract

(1) abstract
Register abstract

this abstract

can abstract
be abstract

e.g., abstract
the abstract
knowledge abstract
that abstract

We abstract
show abstract

Abstract: abstract
Clustering abstract
is abstract
often abstract
used abstract
for abstract
discovering abstract
structure abstract
in abstract
data. abstract
Clustering abstract
systems abstract
+L+ other
differ abstract
in abstract
the abstract
objective abstract
function abstract
used abstract
to abstract
evaluate abstract
clustering abstract
quality abstract
and abstract
the abstract
control abstract
strategy abstract
+L+ other
used abstract
to abstract
search abstract
the abstract
space abstract
of abstract
clusterings. abstract
Ideally, abstract
the abstract
search abstract
strategy abstract
should abstract
consistently abstract
+L+ other
construct abstract
clusterings abstract
of abstract
high abstract
quality, abstract
but abstract
be abstract
computationally abstract
inexpensive abstract
as abstract
well. abstract
In abstract
general, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
cannot abstract
have abstract
it abstract
both abstract
ways, abstract
but abstract
we abstract
can abstract
partition abstract
the abstract
search abstract
so abstract
that abstract
a abstract
system abstract
inexpensively abstract
+L+ other
constructs abstract
a abstract
`tentative' abstract
clustering abstract
for abstract
initial abstract
examination, abstract
followed abstract
by abstract
iterative abstract
optimization, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
continues abstract
to abstract
search abstract
in abstract
background abstract
for abstract
improved abstract
clusterings. abstract
Given abstract
this abstract
motivation, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
an abstract
inexpensive abstract
strategy abstract
for abstract
creating abstract
initial abstract
clusterings, abstract
coupled abstract
with abstract
several abstract
control abstract
+L+ other
strategies abstract
for abstract
iterative abstract
optimization, abstract
each abstract
of abstract
which abstract
repeatedly abstract
modifies abstract
an abstract
initial abstract
clustering abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
search abstract
of abstract
a abstract
better abstract
one. abstract
One abstract
of abstract
these abstract
methods abstract
appears abstract
novel abstract
as abstract
an abstract
iterative abstract
optimization abstract
+L+ other
strategy abstract
in abstract
clustering abstract
contexts. abstract
Once abstract
a abstract
clustering abstract
has abstract
been abstract
constructed abstract
it abstract
is abstract
judged abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
analysts abstract
often abstract
according abstract
to abstract
task-specific abstract
criteria. abstract
Several abstract
authors abstract
have abstract
abstracted abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
criteria abstract
and abstract
posited abstract
a abstract
generic abstract
performance abstract
task abstract
akin abstract
to abstract
pattern abstract
completion, abstract
where abstract
the abstract
error abstract
+L+ other
rate abstract
over abstract
completed abstract
patterns abstract
is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
`externally' abstract
judge abstract
clustering abstract
utility. abstract
Given abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
performance abstract
task abstract
we abstract
adapt abstract
resampling-based abstract
pruning abstract
strategies abstract
used abstract
by abstract
supervised abstract
learning abstract
+L+ other
systems abstract
to abstract
the abstract
task abstract
of abstract
simplifying abstract
hierarchical abstract
clusterings, abstract
thus abstract
promising abstract
to abstract
ease abstract
post-clustering abstract
analysis. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
number abstract
of abstract
objective abstract
functions, abstract
based abstract
on abstract
attribute-selection abstract
measures abstract
for abstract
decision-tree abstract
induction, abstract
that abstract
might abstract
perform abstract
well abstract
on abstract
the abstract
error abstract
rate abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
simplicity abstract
dimensions. abstract

As abstract
the abstract
difference abstract
in abstract
speed abstract
between abstract
processor abstract
and abstract
memory abstract
system abstract
continues abstract
to abstract
increase, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
becoming abstract
crucial abstract
to abstract
develop abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
refine abstract
techniques abstract
that abstract
enhance abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
cache abstract
+L+ other
hierarchies. abstract
Two abstract
such abstract
techniques abstract
are abstract
data abstract
prefetching abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
data abstract
forwarding. abstract
With abstract
prefetching, abstract
a abstract
processor abstract
hides abstract
the abstract
latency abstract
of abstract
cache abstract
misses abstract
by abstract
requesting abstract
the abstract
data abstract
before abstract
it abstract
actually abstract
+L+ other
needs abstract
it. abstract
With abstract
forwarding, abstract
a abstract
producer abstract
processor abstract
hides abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
latency abstract
of abstract
communication-induced abstract
cache abstract
misses abstract
in abstract
the abstract
consumer abstract
processors abstract
by abstract
sending abstract
the abstract
data abstract
to abstract
the abstract
caches abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
latter. abstract
These abstract
two abstract
techniques abstract
are abstract
complementary abstract
approaches abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
hiding abstract
the abstract
latency abstract
of abstract
communication-induced abstract
misses. abstract
+L+ other
This abstract
paper abstract
compares abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
data abstract
forwarding abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
data abstract
prefetching abstract
to abstract
hide abstract
communication-induced abstract
misses. abstract
+L+ other
Although abstract
both abstract
techniques abstract
require abstract
comparable abstract
hardware abstract
support, abstract
forwarding abstract
usually abstract
has abstract
a abstract
lower abstract
instruction abstract
overhead. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
prefetching abstract
and abstract
forwarding abstract
algorithms abstract
in abstract
a abstract
paralleliz-ing abstract
compiler abstract
using abstract
execution-driven abstract
simulations abstract
of abstract
a abstract
shared-memory abstract
multiprocessor. abstract
Both abstract
data abstract
forwarding abstract
and abstract
prefetch-ing abstract
reduce abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
time abstract
of abstract
applications abstract
significantly abstract
(30-40% abstract
on abstract
average). abstract
Forwarding abstract
performs abstract
better abstract
on abstract
average, abstract
+L+ other
while abstract
prefetching abstract
is abstract
more abstract
robust abstract
to abstract
changes abstract
in abstract
cache abstract
and abstract
memory abstract
parameters. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
two abstract
ways abstract
of abstract
integrating abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
two abstract
techniques. abstract
The abstract
integration abstract
of abstract
the abstract
two abstract
techniques abstract
reduces abstract
the abstract

Optimizing abstract
on-chip abstract
primary abstract
data abstract
caches abstract
for abstract
parallel abstract
scientific abstract
applications abstract
is abstract
challenging abstract
because abstract
different abstract
applications abstract
+L+ other
exhibit abstract
different abstract
behavior. abstract
Indeed, abstract
while abstract
some abstract
applications abstract
+L+ other
exhibit abstract
good abstract
spatial abstract
locality, abstract
others abstract
have abstract
accesses abstract
with abstract
long abstract
+L+ other
strides abstract
that abstract
prevent abstract
the abstract
effective abstract
use abstract
of abstract
cache abstract
lines. abstract
Finally, abstract
+L+ other
other abstract
applications abstract
cannot abstract
exploit abstract
long abstract
lines abstract
because abstract
they abstract
exhibit abstract
false abstract
sharing. abstract
To abstract
help abstract
processors abstract
execute abstract
these abstract
three abstract
+L+ other
types abstract
of abstract
applications abstract
efficiently, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
the abstract
Pool abstract
Buffer, abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
small abstract
direct-mapped abstract
cache abstract
accessed abstract
in abstract
parallel abstract
with abstract
the abstract
primary abstract
cache. abstract
The abstract
function abstract
of abstract
the abstract
pool abstract
buffer abstract
is abstract
to abstract
fetch abstract
long abstract
+L+ other
sectors abstract
of abstract
relatively abstract
short abstract
cache abstract
lines abstract
from abstract
memory abstract
on abstract
a abstract
miss, abstract
+L+ other
while abstract
only abstract
letting abstract
into abstract
the abstract
cache abstract
the abstract
lines abstract
that abstract
the abstract
processor abstract
+L+ other
actually abstract
references. abstract
The abstract
pool abstract
buffer abstract
can abstract
also abstract
perform abstract
sequential abstract
prefetching abstract
of abstract
sectors. abstract
+L+ other
An abstract
evaluation abstract
of abstract
the abstract
pool abstract
buffer abstract
based abstract
on abstract
simulations abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
five abstract
32-processor abstract
Perfect abstract
Club abstract

encouraging abstract
results. abstract
Adding abstract
a abstract
pool abstract
buffer abstract
of abstract
one-quarter abstract
the abstract
size abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
cache abstract
causes abstract
a abstract
small abstract
increase abstract
in abstract
area abstract
while abstract
usually abstract
achieving abstract
+L+ other
large abstract
reductions abstract
in abstract
execution abstract
time. abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
for abstract
a abstract
range abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
caches abstract
with abstract
32-byte abstract
lines, abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
time abstract
decreases abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
an abstract
average abstract
of abstract
about abstract
20%. abstract
We abstract
also abstract
show abstract
that abstract
small abstract
1-Kbyte abstract
+L+ other
buffers abstract
are abstract
often abstract
large abstract
enough abstract
to abstract
get abstract
most abstract
of abstract
the abstract
potential abstract
+L+ other
benefits. abstract
Finally, abstract
caches abstract
with abstract
pool abstract
buffers abstract
are abstract
more abstract
effective abstract
+L+ other
than abstract
caches abstract
with abstract
long abstract

and abstract
no abstract

showing abstract
how abstract

The abstract

We abstract
extend abstract
+L+ other
this abstract
class abstract
of abstract

in abstract
three abstract
ways. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
a abstract
new abstract
+L+ other
object-order abstract
rendering abstract
algorithm abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
factorization abstract
that abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
significantly abstract
faster abstract
than abstract
published abstract
algorithms abstract
with abstract
minimal abstract
loss abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
image abstract
quality. abstract
Shear-warp abstract
factorizations abstract
have abstract
the abstract
property abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
rows abstract
of abstract
voxels abstract
in abstract
the abstract
volume abstract
are abstract
aligned abstract
with abstract
rows abstract
of abstract
pixels abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
intermediate abstract
image. abstract
We abstract
use abstract
this abstract
fact abstract
to abstract
construct abstract
a abstract
scanline-based abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
that abstract
traverses abstract
the abstract
volume abstract
and abstract
the abstract
intermediate abstract
image abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
synchrony, abstract
taking abstract
advantage abstract
of abstract
the abstract
spatial abstract
coherence abstract
present abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
both. abstract
We abstract
use abstract
spatial abstract
data abstract
structures abstract
based abstract
on abstract
run-length abstract
encoding abstract
+L+ other
for abstract
both abstract
the abstract
volume abstract
and abstract
the abstract
intermediate abstract
image. abstract

transformations, abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
show abstract
how abstract
our abstract
rendering abstract
algorithm abstract
can abstract
support abstract
this abstract
extension. abstract
+L+ other
Third, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
data abstract
structure abstract
for abstract
encoding abstract
spatial abstract
coherence abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
unclassified abstract
volumes abstract
(i.e. abstract
scalar abstract

with abstract
no abstract
precomputed abstract

When abstract
combined abstract
with abstract
our abstract
shear-warp abstract

to abstract

Abstract: abstract
We abstract

The abstract

are abstract
joined abstract
merely abstract
through abstract
functional abstract

Each abstract

support abstract
a abstract

such abstract

The abstract

composing abstract
some abstract

Our abstract

We abstract
circumvent abstract
this abstract

a abstract

We abstract

We abstract
have abstract
developed abstract
a abstract
new abstract
Bayesian abstract
framework abstract
for abstract
visual abstract
object abstract

recognition abstract
which abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
insight abstract
that abstract

can abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
modeled abstract
as abstract
a abstract
conjunction abstract
of abstract

This abstract
framework abstract
can abstract

used abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
both abstract
derive abstract
an abstract

and abstract
an abstract
algorithm abstract
for abstract

learning abstract

themselves. abstract
The abstract
overall abstract
approach, abstract
called abstract
complex abstract
+L+ other
feature abstract
recognition abstract
or abstract
CFR, abstract
is abstract
unique abstract
for abstract
several abstract
reasons: abstract
it abstract
is abstract
broadly abstract
+L+ other
applicable abstract
to abstract
a abstract
wide abstract
range abstract
of abstract
object abstract
types, abstract
it abstract
makes abstract
constructing abstract

easy, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
capable abstract
of abstract
identifying abstract
either abstract

an abstract

it abstract
is abstract

+L+ other
Instead abstract
of abstract
a abstract
single abstract

such abstract

an abstract

CFR abstract
uses abstract

large abstract

set abstract
of abstract
complex abstract
features abstract
that abstract
are abstract
learned abstract
from abstract
experience abstract
with abstract

The abstract
response abstract
of abstract
a abstract
single abstract
complex abstract

contains abstract
much abstract
more abstract
+L+ other

information abstract
than abstract
does abstract
a abstract

This abstract
significantly abstract
reduces abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
number abstract

The abstract

This abstract
article abstract
presents abstract
a abstract
software-only abstract
solution abstract
to abstract
the abstract
synchronization abstract
problem abstract
for abstract
uniprocessors. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
idea abstract
is abstract
to abstract
execute abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
without abstract
any abstract
hardware abstract
protection, abstract
and abstract
in abstract
the abstract
rare abstract
case abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
pre-emption, abstract
to abstract
roll abstract
the abstract
sequence abstract
forward abstract
to abstract
the abstract
end, abstract
thereby abstract
preserving abstract
atomicity. abstract
One abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
proposed abstract
implementations abstract
protects abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
without abstract
any abstract
memory-accesses. abstract
This abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
significant abstract
as abstract
it abstract
enables abstract
execution abstract
at abstract
CPU-speeds, abstract
rather abstract
than abstract
memory-speeds. abstract
The abstract
benefit abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
this abstract
method abstract
increases abstract
with abstract
the abstract
frequency abstract
at abstract
which abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
are abstract
executed. abstract
It abstract
therefore abstract
+L+ other
encourages abstract
the abstract
building abstract
of abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
fine-grained abstract
synchronization. abstract
This abstract
has abstract
the abstract
additional abstract
+L+ other
advantage abstract
of abstract
reducing abstract
average abstract
latency. abstract
Experiments abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
this abstract
technique abstract
has abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
potential abstract
to abstract
outperform abstract
even abstract
the abstract
best abstract
hardware abstract
mechanisms. abstract
The abstract
main abstract
contribution abstract
of abstract
this abstract

+L+ other
is abstract
to abstract
discuss abstract

we abstract

that abstract
facilitates abstract
building abstract

The abstract

The abstract

a abstract
matching abstract

In abstract
this abstract

we abstract
introduce abstract

a abstract

representation abstract
+L+ other
where abstract
correspondence abstract
has abstract
been abstract
established abstract
with abstract
respect abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
a abstract

The abstract
representation abstract
consists abstract
of abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
image abstract
measurements abstract
made abstract
at abstract
the abstract

points: abstract
shape abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
present abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
creating abstract
realistic abstract
synthetic abstract
views abstract
of abstract
existing abstract
architectural abstract
+L+ other
scenes abstract
from abstract
a abstract
sparse abstract
set abstract
of abstract
still abstract
photographs. abstract
Our abstract
approach, abstract
which abstract
combines abstract
both abstract
geometry-based abstract
and abstract
image-based abstract
modeling abstract
and abstract
rendering abstract
techniques, abstract
has abstract
two abstract
components. abstract
The abstract
first abstract
+L+ other
component abstract
is abstract
an abstract
easy-to-use abstract
photogrammetric abstract
modeling abstract
system abstract
which abstract
facilitates abstract
the abstract
recovery abstract
of abstract
a abstract
basic abstract
geometric abstract
model abstract
of abstract
the abstract
photographed abstract
scene. abstract
The abstract
modeling abstract
system abstract
is abstract
effective abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
robust abstract
because abstract
it abstract
exploits abstract
the abstract
constraints abstract
that abstract
are abstract
characteristic abstract
of abstract
architectural abstract
scenes. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
second abstract
component abstract
is abstract
a abstract
model-based abstract
stereo abstract
algorithm, abstract
which abstract
recovers abstract
how abstract
the abstract
real abstract
scene abstract
+L+ other
deviates abstract
from abstract
the abstract
basic abstract
model. abstract
By abstract
making abstract
use abstract
of abstract
the abstract
model, abstract
our abstract
stereo abstract
approach abstract
can abstract
robustly abstract
+L+ other
recover abstract
accurate abstract
depth abstract
from abstract
image abstract
pairs abstract
with abstract
large abstract
baselines. abstract
Consequently, abstract
our abstract
approach abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
model abstract
large abstract
architectural abstract
environments abstract
with abstract
far abstract
fewer abstract
photographs abstract
than abstract
current abstract
image-based abstract
modeling abstract
approaches. abstract
As abstract
an abstract
intermediate abstract
result, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
view-dependent abstract
texture abstract
+L+ other
mapping, abstract
a abstract
method abstract
of abstract
better abstract
simulating abstract
geometric abstract
detail abstract
on abstract
basic abstract
models. abstract
Our abstract
approach abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
recover abstract
models abstract
for abstract
use abstract
in abstract
either abstract
geometry-based abstract
or abstract
image-based abstract
rendering abstract
systems. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
present abstract
results abstract
that abstract
demonstrate abstract
our abstract
approach's abstract
abilty abstract
to abstract
create abstract
realistic abstract
renderings abstract

In abstract

demonstrate abstract
that abstract
Hybrid abstract
Cache abstract
always abstract
dominates abstract

and abstract
significantly abstract
outperforms abstract

in abstract
many abstract

This abstract
provides abstract
new abstract
insights abstract
into abstract
the abstract
tradeoff abstract
between abstract
hashing abstract
and abstract

for abstract

operations. abstract
Additionally, abstract
our abstract
Hybrid abstract

algorithm abstract
includes abstract
some abstract

for abstract

which abstract
can abstract

The abstract

However abstract
rather abstract

which abstract

This abstract

proposes abstract

Using abstract

integrates abstract

Together, abstract
both abstract

a abstract

efficiently, abstract
to abstract
eliminate abstract

this abstract

Currently, abstract

The abstract
problem abstract
of abstract
belief abstract
changehow abstract
an abstract
agent abstract
should abstract
revise abstract
her abstract
beliefs abstract
upon abstract
learning abstract
new abstract
+L+ other
informationhas abstract
been abstract
an abstract
active abstract
area abstract
of abstract
research abstract
in abstract
both abstract
philosophy abstract
and abstract
artificial abstract
intelligence. abstract
+L+ other
Many abstract
approaches abstract
to abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
have abstract
been abstract
proposed abstract
in abstract
the abstract
literature. abstract
Our abstract
goal abstract
is abstract
not abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
introduce abstract
yet abstract
another abstract
approach, abstract
but abstract
to abstract
examine abstract
carefully abstract
the abstract
rationale abstract
underlying abstract
the abstract
approaches abstract
+L+ other
already abstract
taken abstract
in abstract
the abstract
literature, abstract
and abstract
to abstract
highlight abstract
what abstract
we abstract
view abstract
as abstract
methodological abstract
problems abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
literature. abstract
The abstract
main abstract
message abstract
is abstract
that abstract
to abstract
study abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
carefully, abstract
we abstract
must abstract
be abstract
quite abstract
explicit abstract
+L+ other
about abstract
the abstract
ontology abstract
or abstract
scenario abstract
underlying abstract
the abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
process. abstract
This abstract
is abstract
something abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
has abstract
been abstract
missing abstract
in abstract
previous abstract
work, abstract
with abstract
its abstract
focus abstract
on abstract
postulates. abstract
Our abstract
analysis abstract
shows abstract
that abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
must abstract
pay abstract
particular abstract
attention abstract
to abstract
two abstract
issues abstract
which abstract
have abstract
often abstract
been abstract
taken abstract
for abstract
granted: abstract
The abstract
first abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
how abstract
we abstract
model abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
epistemic abstract
state. abstract
(Do abstract
we abstract
use abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
beliefs, abstract
or abstract
a abstract
richer abstract
structure, abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
an abstract
ordering abstract
on abstract
worlds? abstract
And abstract
if abstract
we abstract
use abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
beliefs, abstract
in abstract
what abstract
language abstract
are abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
beliefs abstract
are abstract
expressed?) abstract
The abstract
second abstract
is abstract
the abstract
status abstract
of abstract
observations. abstract
(Are abstract
observations abstract
known abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
true, abstract
or abstract
just abstract
believed? abstract
In abstract
the abstract
latter abstract
case, abstract
how abstract
firm abstract
is abstract
the abstract
belief?) abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
we abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
even abstract
postulates abstract
that abstract
have abstract
been abstract
called abstract
beyond abstract
controversy abstract
are abstract
unreasonable abstract
when abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
+L+ other
beliefs abstract
include abstract
beliefs abstract
about abstract
her abstract
own abstract
epistemic abstract
state abstract
as abstract
well abstract
as abstract
the abstract
external abstract
world. abstract
Issues abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
status abstract
of abstract
observations abstract
arise abstract
particularly abstract
when abstract
we abstract
consider abstract
iterated abstract
belief abstract
revision, abstract
and abstract
we abstract
must abstract
+L+ other
confront abstract
the abstract
possibility abstract
of abstract
revising abstract
by abstract
' abstract
and abstract
then abstract
by abstract
:'. abstract

investigates abstract

We abstract

it abstract

(such abstract

We abstract

the abstract

As abstract

we abstract

We abstract

The abstract

a abstract

In abstract
this abstract

we abstract

We abstract
present abstract

The abstract

our abstract

for abstract
a abstract

theoretically abstract

This abstract

Unlike abstract

we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract

This abstract

The abstract
abstract abstract

We abstract
discuss abstract

Finally, abstract

this abstract

However, abstract

To abstract

we abstract

a abstract
new abstract
class abstract

operations abstract
called abstract
informing abstract

operations, abstract
which abstract
essentially abstract

a abstract

Neural abstract
networks abstract
have abstract
been abstract
successfully abstract
applied abstract
in abstract
a abstract
wide abstract
range abstract
of abstract
supervised abstract
and abstract
unsupervised abstract
learning abstract
applications. abstract
Neural-network abstract
methods abstract
are abstract
not abstract
commonly abstract
used abstract
for abstract
data-mining abstract
+L+ other
tasks, abstract
however, abstract
because abstract
they abstract
often abstract
produce abstract
incomprehensible abstract
models abstract
and abstract
require abstract
long abstract
training abstract
+L+ other
times. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
article, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
neural-network abstract
learning abstract
algorithms abstract
that abstract
are abstract
able abstract
to abstract
produce abstract
+L+ other
comprehensible abstract
models, abstract
and abstract
that abstract
do abstract
not abstract
require abstract
excessive abstract
training abstract
times. abstract
Specifically, abstract
we abstract
discuss abstract
+L+ other
two abstract
classes abstract
of abstract
approaches abstract
for abstract
data abstract
mining abstract
with abstract
neural abstract
networks. abstract
The abstract
first abstract
type abstract
of abstract
approach, abstract
+L+ other
often abstract
called abstract
rule abstract
extraction, abstract
involves abstract
extracting abstract
symbolic abstract
models abstract
from abstract
trained abstract
neural abstract
networks. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
second abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
to abstract
directly abstract
learn abstract
simple, abstract
easy-to-understand abstract
networks. abstract
We abstract
argue abstract
that, abstract
+L+ other
given abstract
the abstract
current abstract
state abstract

the abstract
art, abstract
neural-network abstract
methods abstract
deserve abstract
a abstract

The abstract

is abstract
that abstract

Further, abstract

Inversion abstract
of abstract
multilayer abstract

networks abstract
is abstract
a abstract
method abstract
which abstract
tries abstract
to abstract
answer abstract
questions abstract
+L+ other
like abstract
"What abstract
kind abstract
of abstract
input abstract
will abstract
give abstract
a abstract
desired abstract
output?" abstract
or abstract
"Is abstract
it abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
get abstract
a abstract
desired abstract
+L+ other
output abstract
(under abstract
special abstract
input/output abstract
constraints)?". abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
will abstract
describe abstract
two abstract
methods abstract
of abstract
inverting abstract
a abstract
connectionist abstract
network. abstract
Firstly, abstract
we abstract
extend abstract
+L+ other
inversion abstract
via abstract
backpropagation abstract
(Linden/Kindermann abstract
[4], abstract
Williams abstract
[11]) abstract
to abstract
recurrent abstract
(El-man abstract
[1], abstract
Jordan abstract
[3], abstract
Mozer abstract
[5], abstract
Williams/Zipser abstract
[10]), abstract
time-delayed abstract
(Waibel abstract
at abstract
al. abstract
[9]) abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
discrete abstract
versions abstract
of abstract
continuous abstract
networks abstract
(Pineda abstract
[7], abstract
Pearlmutter abstract
[6]). abstract
The abstract
result abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
inversion abstract
is abstract
an abstract
input abstract
vector. abstract
The abstract
corresponding abstract
output abstract
vector abstract
is abstract
equal abstract
to abstract
the abstract
target abstract
+L+ other
vector abstract
except abstract
a abstract
small abstract
remainder. abstract
The abstract
knowledge abstract
of abstract
those abstract
attractors abstract
may abstract
help abstract
to abstract
understand abstract
the abstract
function abstract
and abstract
the abstract
generalization abstract
qualities abstract
of abstract
connectionist abstract
systems abstract
of abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
kind. abstract
+L+ other
Secondly, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
new abstract
inversion abstract
method abstract
for abstract
proving abstract
the abstract
non-existence abstract
of abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
input abstract
combination abstract
under abstract
special abstract
constraints, abstract
e.g. abstract
in abstract
a abstract
subspace abstract
of abstract
the abstract
input abstract
space. abstract
This abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
works abstract
by abstract
iterative abstract
exclusion abstract
of abstract
invalid abstract
activation abstract
values. abstract
It abstract
might abstract
be abstract
a abstract
helpful abstract
+L+ other
way abstract
to abstract
judge abstract
the abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
a abstract
trained abstract
network. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
conclude abstract
with abstract
simulation abstract
results abstract
of abstract
three abstract
different abstract
tasks: abstract
XOR, abstract
morse abstract
signal abstract
decoding abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
handwritten abstract
digit abstract
recognition. abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
evaluate abstract
storage abstract
system abstract
alternatives abstract
for abstract
movies-on-demand abstract
video abstract
servers. abstract
We abstract
begin abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
characterizing abstract
the abstract
movies-on-demand abstract
workload. abstract
Then abstract
we abstract
study abstract
disk abstract
farms abstract
in abstract
which abstract
one abstract
movie abstract
is abstract
stored abstract
per abstract
+L+ other
disk. abstract
This abstract
is abstract
a abstract
simple abstract
scheme, abstract
but abstract
it abstract
wastes abstract
substantial abstract
disk abstract
bandwidth, abstract
since abstract
disks abstract
holding abstract
less abstract
popular abstract
+L+ other
movies abstract
are abstract
under-utilized; abstract
also, abstract
good abstract
performance abstract
requires abstract
that abstract
movies abstract
be abstract
replicated abstract
to abstract
reflect abstract
the abstract
user abstract
+L+ other
request abstract
pattern. abstract
Next, abstract
we abstract
examine abstract
disk abstract
farms abstract
in abstract
which abstract
movies abstract
are abstract
striped abstract
across abstract
disks, abstract
and abstract
find abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
striped abstract
video abstract
servers abstract
offer abstract
close abstract
to abstract
full abstract
utilization abstract
of abstract
the abstract
disks abstract
by abstract
achieving abstract
better abstract
load abstract
balancing. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
storage abstract
hierarchies abstract
for abstract
video abstract
service abstract
that abstract
include abstract
a abstract
tertiary abstract
library abstract
along abstract
with abstract
a abstract
disk abstract
farm. abstract

Unfortunately, abstract
we abstract

the abstract

neither abstract

optical abstract

is abstract

We abstract
suggest abstract

Abstract. abstract
The abstract
core abstract
of abstract
multiple-view abstract
geometry abstract
is abstract
governed abstract
by abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
and abstract
the abstract
trilinear abstract
+L+ other
tensor. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
unify abstract
both abstract
representations abstract
by abstract
first abstract
re-deriving abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
as abstract
a abstract
rank abstract
+L+ other
deficient abstract
tensor, abstract
and abstract
secondly abstract
by abstract
deriving abstract
a abstract
unified abstract
set abstract
of abstract
operators abstract
that abstract
are abstract
transparent abstract
to abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
views. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
result, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
that abstract
the abstract
basic abstract
building abstract
block abstract
of abstract
the abstract
geometry abstract
of abstract
multiple abstract
views abstract
is abstract
the abstract
trilinear abstract
+L+ other
tensor abstract
of abstract
three abstract
views abstract
and abstract
that abstract
this abstract
tensor abstract
specializes abstract
to abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
(in abstract
it's abstract
tensor abstract
form) abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
case abstract
of abstract
two abstract
views. abstract
The abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
tensor abstract
(geometric abstract
interpretation, abstract
contraction abstract
properties, abstract
+L+ other
etc.) abstract
are abstract
independent abstract
of abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
views abstract
(two abstract
or abstract
three). abstract
As abstract
a abstract
byproduct, abstract
every abstract
two-view abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
considered abstract
as abstract
a abstract
degenerate abstract
three-view abstract
algorithm abstract
and abstract
three-view abstract
algorithms abstract
can abstract
work abstract
with abstract
either abstract
+L+ other
two abstract
or abstract
three abstract
images, abstract
all abstract
using abstract
one abstract
standard abstract
set abstract
of abstract
tensor abstract
operations. abstract
To abstract
highlight abstract
the abstract
usefulness abstract
of abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
paradigm abstract
we abstract
provide abstract
two abstract
practical abstract
applications. abstract
First abstract
we abstract
present abstract
a abstract
novel abstract

that abstract
+L+ other
starts abstract
with abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
(in abstract

and abstract
seamlessly abstract
move abstract
to abstract
the abstract
general abstract
trilinear abstract
+L+ other
tensor, abstract
all abstract
using abstract
one abstract
set abstract
of abstract
tensor abstract
operations. abstract
The abstract
second abstract
application abstract
is abstract
a abstract
camera abstract

algorithm, abstract
+L+ other
originally abstract
introduced abstract
for abstract
three abstract
views, abstract
now abstract

Problems abstract

applying abstract
these abstract

The abstract

it abstract

and abstract
to abstract
assure abstract
that abstract
the abstract

+L+ other

We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
these abstract

be abstract
overcome abstract
by abstract
using abstract
goals abstract
and abstract
experience abstract
to abstract
guide abstract
both abstract
+L+ other
explanation abstract

and abstract

Our abstract
work abstract
is abstract
within abstract
the abstract
framework abstract
of abstract
case-based abstract
explanation, abstract
which abstract
builds abstract
explanations abstract
by abstract
retrieving abstract
and abstract
adapting abstract
prior abstract
explanations abstract
stored abstract
in abstract

We abstract
substantiate abstract
our abstract
model abstract
by abstract
describing abstract
mechanisms abstract
that abstract
enable abstract
it abstract
to abstract
effectively abstract
generate abstract
good abstract
+L+ other
explanations. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
there abstract
exists abstract
a abstract
theory abstract
of abstract
anomaly abstract
and abstract
explanation abstract
that abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
guide abstract
retrieval abstract
of abstract
relevant abstract
explanations. abstract
Second, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
a abstract
plausibility abstract
evaluation abstract
process abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
efficiently abstract
detects abstract
conflicts abstract
and abstract
confirmations abstract
of abstract
an abstract
explanation's abstract
assumptions abstract

prior abstract
patterns, abstract
+L+ other
making abstract
it abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
focus abstract
explanation abstract
adaptation abstract
when abstract
retrieved abstract
explanations abstract
are abstract
implausible. abstract
+L+ other
Third, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
methods abstract
for abstract
judging abstract
whether abstract
explanations abstract
provide abstract
the abstract
information abstract
needed abstract
to abstract
satisfy abstract
explainer abstract
goals abstract
beyond abstract
routine abstract
understanding. abstract
By abstract

the abstract
search abstract

provides abstract
a abstract

The abstract

The abstract
distribution abstract
of abstract
resources abstract
among abstract
processors, abstract
memory abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
caches abstract
is abstract
a abstract
crucial abstract
question abstract
faced abstract
by abstract
designers abstract
of abstract
large-scale abstract
+L+ other
parallel abstract
machines. abstract
If abstract
a abstract
machine abstract
is abstract
to abstract
solve abstract
problems abstract
with abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
certain abstract
data abstract
set abstract
size, abstract
should abstract
it abstract
be abstract
built abstract
with abstract
a abstract
large abstract
number abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
processors abstract
each abstract
with abstract
a abstract
small abstract
amount abstract
of abstract
memory, abstract
or abstract
a abstract
smaller abstract
+L+ other
number abstract
of abstract
processors abstract
each abstract
with abstract
a abstract
large abstract
amount abstract
of abstract
memory? abstract
+L+ other
How abstract
much abstract
cache abstract
memory abstract
should abstract
be abstract
provided abstract
per abstract
processor abstract
for abstract
+L+ other
cost-effectiveness? abstract
And abstract
how abstract
do abstract
these abstract
decisions abstract
change abstract
as abstract
larger abstract
+L+ other
problems abstract
are abstract
run abstract
on abstract
larger abstract
machines? abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
explore abstract
the abstract
above abstract
questions abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
characteristics abstract
of abstract
five abstract
important abstract
classes abstract
of abstract
large-scale abstract
parallel abstract
scientific abstract
applications. abstract
We abstract
first abstract
show abstract
that abstract
all abstract
the abstract
applications abstract
have abstract
a abstract
hierarchy abstract
of abstract
well-defined abstract
per-processor abstract
working abstract
+L+ other
sets, abstract
whose abstract
size, abstract
performance abstract
impact abstract
and abstract
scaling abstract
characteristics abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
help abstract
determine abstract
how abstract
large abstract
different abstract
levels abstract
of abstract
a abstract
multiprocessor's abstract
cache abstract
hierarchy abstract
should abstract
be. abstract
Then, abstract
we abstract
use abstract
these abstract
working abstract
sets abstract
together abstract
with abstract
certain abstract
other abstract
important abstract
characteristics abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
applications|such abstract
as abstract
communication abstract
to abstract
computation abstract
ratios, abstract
+L+ other
concurrency, abstract
and abstract
load abstract
balancing abstract
behavior|to abstract
reflect abstract
upon abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
broader abstract
question abstract
of abstract
the abstract
granularity abstract
of abstract
processing abstract
nodes abstract
in abstract
high-performance abstract
multiprocessors. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
find abstract
that abstract
very abstract
small abstract
caches abstract
whose abstract
sizes abstract
do abstract
not abstract
increase abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
the abstract
problem abstract
or abstract
machine abstract
size abstract
are abstract
adequate abstract
for abstract
all abstract
but abstract
two abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
application abstract
classes. abstract
Even abstract
in abstract
the abstract
two abstract
exceptions, abstract
the abstract
working abstract
+L+ other
sets abstract
scale abstract
quite abstract
slowly abstract
with abstract
problem abstract
size, abstract
and abstract
the abstract

+L+ other
needed abstract
for abstract
problems abstract
that abstract
will abstract
be abstract
run abstract
in abstract
the abstract
foreseeable abstract
future abstract
+L+ other
are abstract
small. abstract
We abstract
also abstract
find abstract
that abstract
relatively abstract
fine-grained abstract
machines, abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
large abstract
numbers abstract
of abstract
processors abstract
and abstract
quite abstract

of abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
Recently, abstract
several abstract
theoretical abstract
models abstract
of abstract
parallel abstract
architectures abstract
have abstract
been abstract
proposed abstract
to abstract
replace abstract
the abstract
PRAM abstract
as abstract
the abstract
model abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
is abstract
presented abstract
to abstract
an abstract
algorithm abstract
designer. abstract
A abstract
primary abstract
focus abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
new abstract
models abstract
is abstract
to abstract
include abstract
the abstract
cost abstract
of abstract
interprocessor abstract
communication, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
increasingly abstract
important abstract
in abstract
modern abstract
parallel abstract
+L+ other
architectures. abstract
We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
modeling abstract
the abstract
communication abstract
costs abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
the abstract
architecture abstract
or abstract
system abstract
is abstract
only abstract
one abstract
part abstract
of abstract
the abstract
problem. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
other, abstract
and abstract
usually abstract
much abstract
more abstract
difficult, abstract
part abstract
is abstract
modeling abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
communication abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
algorithm abstract
itself, abstract
which abstract
+L+ other
provides abstract
necessary abstract
inputs abstract
into abstract
the abstract

model abstract
to abstract
determine abstract
overall abstract
complexity. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
context, abstract
we abstract
make abstract
three abstract
main abstract
+L+ other

this abstract
paper: abstract
(i) abstract
It abstract
is abstract
incomplete abstract
to abstract
describe abstract
communication abstract

We abstract
+L+ other
propose abstract
a abstract
description abstract
of abstract
the abstract
communication-replication abstract
relationship abstract
in abstract
terms abstract
of abstract
the abstract
working abstract
set abstract
hierarchy abstract
of abstract
an abstract
algorithm. abstract
+L+ other
(ii) abstract
Both abstract
inherent abstract
communication abstract
and abstract
the abstract
communication-replication abstract
relationship abstract
can abstract
be abstract
very abstract
difficult abstract
to abstract
model abstract
in abstract
irregular, abstract
dynamic abstract
computations abstract
that abstract
are abstract
crucial abstract
in abstract
many abstract
real-world abstract
+L+ other
applications. abstract
We abstract
present abstract
some abstract

this abstract

(iii) abstract

The abstract

There abstract

an abstract

consensus abstract
that abstract
an abstract

would abstract
be abstract
invaluable abstract

But abstract
the abstract

maintained. abstract
Second, abstract
our abstract

While abstract
the abstract

from abstract
an abstract

+L+ other

if abstract
the abstract

This abstract

more abstract

a abstract
"Horn abstract
approximation"; abstract
i.e., abstract
a abstract
horn abstract
theory abstract
that abstract

semantically abstract
similar abstract

the abstract
original abstract

theory. abstract
The abstract

how abstract

we abstract
therefore abstract
seek abstract
an abstract

Unfortunately, abstract

several abstract

achieving abstract
this abstract
goal abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
practice: abstract
(i) abstract
The abstract

which abstract

typically abstract
not abstract
known abstract
a abstract

(ii) abstract
identifying abstract
the abstract

intractable, abstract
even abstract
given abstract
+L+ other
the abstract

and abstract
(iii) abstract
the abstract
optimal abstract
approximation abstract
might abstract
be abstract
too abstract
large abstract
to abstract
guarantee abstract

tractable abstract
inference. abstract
This abstract

presents abstract
an abstract

each abstract

In abstract

Recovery abstract

A abstract

Central abstract

the abstract

However, abstract

The abstract

In abstract
addition abstract

the abstract

and abstract
key abstract

a abstract
new abstract
problem abstract
involving abstract

is abstract
the abstract

In abstract

without abstract

Moreover, abstract
if abstract

the abstract
disclosure abstract
of abstract
the abstract

The abstract

is abstract
the abstract

use abstract

We abstract
present abstract
a abstract
new abstract
symbolic abstract
model abstract
checking abstract
technique, abstract
which abstract
analyzes abstract
temporal abstract
properties abstract
in abstract
multi-typed abstract
transition abstract
systems. abstract
Specifically, abstract
the abstract
method abstract
uses abstract
multiple abstract
type-specific abstract
data abstract
encodings abstract
to abstract
represent abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
states, abstract
and abstract
it abstract
carries abstract
out abstract
fixpoint abstract
computations abstract
via abstract
the abstract
corresponding abstract
type-specific abstract
symbolic abstract
+L+ other
operations. abstract
In abstract
essence, abstract
different abstract
symbolic abstract
encodings abstract
are abstract
unified abstract
into abstract
one abstract
composite abstract
model abstract
checker. abstract
Any abstract
+L+ other
type-specific abstract
language abstract
can abstract
be abstract
included abstract
in abstract
this abstract
framework abstract
provided abstract
that abstract
the abstract
language abstract
is abstract
closed abstract
under abstract
+L+ other
Boolean abstract
connectives, abstract
propositions abstract
can abstract
be abstract
checked abstract
for abstract
satisfiability, abstract
and abstract
relational abstract
images abstract
can abstract
be abstract
computed. abstract
+L+ other
Our abstract
technique abstract
relies abstract
on abstract
conjunctive abstract
partitioning abstract
of abstract
transition abstract
relations abstract
of abstract
atomic abstract
events abstract
based abstract
on abstract
variable abstract
+L+ other
types abstract
involved, abstract
which abstract
allows abstract
independent abstract
computation abstract
of abstract
one-step abstract
pre- abstract
and abstract
post-conditions abstract
for abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
variable abstract
type. abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
our abstract
method abstract
on abstract
a abstract
nontrivial abstract
data-transfer abstract
protocol, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
contains abstract
a abstract
mixture abstract
of abstract
integer abstract
and abstract
Boolean-valued abstract
variables. abstract
The abstract
protocol abstract
operates abstract
over abstract
an abstract
unreliable abstract
channel abstract
that abstract
can abstract
lose, abstract
duplicate abstract
or abstract
reorder abstract
messages. abstract
Moreover, abstract
the abstract
protocol's abstract
send abstract
and abstract
receive abstract
+L+ other
window abstract
sizes abstract
are abstract
not abstract
specified abstract
in abstract
advance; abstract
rather, abstract
they abstract
are abstract
represented abstract
as abstract
symbolic abstract
constants. abstract
The abstract
resulting abstract
system abstract
was abstract
automatically abstract
verified abstract

our abstract
composite abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
paradigm, abstract
namely, abstract
Ratio abstract
Rules, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
are abstract
quantifiable abstract
in abstract
that abstract
we abstract
can abstract
measure abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
"goodness" abstract
of abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
discovered abstract
rules. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
to abstract
use abstract
the abstract
"guessing abstract
error" abstract
as abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
measure abstract
of abstract
the abstract
"goodness", abstract
that abstract
is, abstract
the abstract
root-mean-square abstract
error abstract
of abstract
the abstract
reconstructed abstract
values abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
the abstract
cells abstract
of abstract
the abstract
given abstract
matrix, abstract
when abstract
we abstract
pretend abstract
that abstract
they abstract
are abstract
unknown. abstract
Another abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
a abstract
novel abstract
method abstract
to abstract
guess abstract
missing/hidden abstract
values abstract
from abstract
the abstract
Ratio abstract
Rules abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
our abstract
method abstract
derives. abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
if abstract
somebody abstract
bought abstract
$10 abstract
of abstract
milk abstract
and abstract
$3 abstract
of abstract
bread, abstract
our abstract
+L+ other
rules abstract
can abstract
"guess" abstract
the abstract
amount abstract
spent abstract
on, abstract
say, abstract
+L+ other
butter. abstract
Thus, abstract
we abstract
can abstract
perform abstract
a abstract
variety abstract
of abstract
important abstract
tasks abstract
such abstract
as abstract
forecasting, abstract
answering abstract
+L+ other
"what-if" abstract
scenarios, abstract
detecting abstract
outliers, abstract
and abstract
visualizing abstract
the abstract

Moreover, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
how abstract

+L+ other
compute abstract

Recently, abstract
content-based abstract
retrieval abstract
of abstract
images abstract

has abstract
become abstract
a abstract
hot abstract
research abstract
area. abstract
The abstract
reason abstract
for abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
the abstract
need abstract
for abstract
effective abstract
and abstract
efficient abstract
techniques, abstract
that abstract
meet abstract
user abstract

In abstract
[GR abstract

previous abstract
approaches abstract
to abstract
content-based abstract
retrieval abstract
is abstract
said abstract
to abstract
have abstract
taken abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
directions. abstract
In abstract
the abstract
first abstract
approach, abstract
image abstract
contents abstract
are abstract
modeled abstract
as abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
attributes abstract
extracted abstract
manually abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
managed abstract
within abstract
the abstract
framework abstract
of abstract
conventional abstract
database-management abstract
systems. abstract
The abstract
second abstract
approach abstract
depends abstract
+L+ other
on abstract
an abstract
integrated abstract
feature-extraction/object-recognition abstract
subsystem abstract
to abstract
overcome abstract
the abstract
limitations abstract
of abstract
attribute-based abstract
retrieval. abstract
However, abstract
it abstract
has abstract
been abstract
also abstract
stated abstract
that abstract
[GR abstract
95] abstract
recent abstract
content-based abstract

systems abstract
+L+ other
recognized abstract
the abstract
need abstract

In abstract
the abstract

The abstract

+L+ other
k-way abstract

reduces abstract

it abstract

the abstract

by abstract
projecting abstract
and abstract
refining abstract
the abstract

to abstract
successively abstract
finer abstract

(uncoarsening abstract

A abstract

our abstract

is abstract
that abstract

Our abstract

while abstract
maintaining abstract
the abstract

We abstract

There abstract

our abstract

The abstract

is abstract
to abstract

A abstract
second abstract

our abstract

Furthermore, abstract

Briefly, abstract

We abstract
describe abstract

design abstract
and abstract
implementation abstract
of abstract
a abstract
persistent abstract
object abstract

+L+ other
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract
dossier abstract
driven abstract
approach. abstract
Objects abstract
are abstract
characterized abstract
by abstract
dossiers abstract
which abstract
describe abstract
both abstract
their abstract
language abstract
defined abstract
and abstract
"extra-linguistic" abstract
properties. abstract
These abstract
dossiers abstract
are abstract
+L+ other

an abstract

The abstract
design abstract
places abstract
very abstract
few abstract
burdens abstract
on abstract
the abstract
application abstract
programmer abstract
and abstract
can abstract
be abstract
used abstract
without abstract
altering abstract
the abstract
data abstract
member abstract
layout abstract
of abstract
application abstract
objects abstract
or abstract
inheriting abstract
from abstract
special abstract
classes. abstract
The abstract
storage abstract

is abstract
kept abstract
simple abstract
to abstract
allow abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
a abstract

of abstract

backends. abstract
In abstract
addition, abstract
these abstract

can abstract
be abstract
used abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
implement abstract
(or abstract
augment) abstract
a abstract
run-time abstract

Finally, abstract
by abstract

also abstract

This abstract

Message abstract
logging abstract
is abstract
a abstract
popular abstract
technique abstract
for abstract
building abstract
low-overhead abstract
protocols abstract
that abstract
tolerate abstract
+L+ other
process abstract
crash abstract
failures. abstract
Past abstract
research abstract
in abstract
message abstract
logging abstract
has abstract
focused abstract
on abstract
studying abstract
the abstract
relative abstract
+L+ other
overhead abstract
imposed abstract
by abstract
pessimistic, abstract
optimistic, abstract
and abstract
causal abstract
protocols abstract
during abstract
failure-free abstract
executions. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
give abstract
the abstract
first abstract
experimental abstract
evaluation abstract
of abstract
the abstract
performance abstract
of abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
protocols abstract
during abstract
recovery. abstract
We abstract
discover abstract
that, abstract
if abstract
a abstract
single abstract
failure abstract
is abstract
to abstract
be abstract
tolerated, abstract
pessimistic abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
causal abstract
protocols abstract
perform abstract
best, abstract
because abstract
they abstract
avoid abstract
rollbacks abstract
of abstract
correct abstract
processes. abstract
For abstract
+L+ other
multiple abstract
failures, abstract
however, abstract
the abstract
dominant abstract
factor abstract
in abstract
determining abstract
performance abstract
becomes abstract
where abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
recovery abstract
information abstract
is abstract
logged abstract
(i.e. abstract
at abstract
the abstract
sender, abstract
at abstract
the abstract
receiver, abstract
or abstract
replicated abstract
at abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
subset abstract
of abstract
the abstract
processes abstract
in abstract
the abstract
system) abstract
rather abstract
than abstract
when abstract
this abstract
information abstract
is abstract
logged abstract
(i.e. abstract
if abstract
+L+ other
logging abstract
is abstract
synchronous abstract
or abstract
asynchronous). abstract
From abstract
our abstract
results, abstract
we abstract
distil abstract
a abstract
few abstract
lessons abstract
that abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
guide abstract
the abstract
design abstract
of abstract
message-logging abstract

low-overhead abstract

STRIPS abstract
is abstract

the abstract
following abstract

Suppose abstract

This abstract

The abstract

However, abstract

We abstract

We abstract

solve abstract

1) abstract

2) abstract
special abstract

In abstract

we abstract
describe abstract
a abstract
so-called abstract
screening abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
learning abstract
robust abstract
processing abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
spontaneously abstract

A abstract
screening abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
a abstract
flat abstract
analysis abstract
which abstract
uses abstract
shallow abstract
sequences abstract
of abstract
category abstract
representations abstract
for abstract
analyzing abstract
an abstract
utterance abstract
at abstract
various abstract
syntactic, abstract
+L+ other
semantic abstract
and abstract
dialog abstract
levels. abstract
Rather abstract
than abstract
using abstract
a abstract
deeply abstract
structured abstract
symbolic abstract
analysis, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
use abstract
a abstract
flat abstract
connectionist abstract
analysis. abstract
This abstract
screening abstract
approach abstract
aims abstract
at abstract
supporting abstract
speech abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
language abstract
processing abstract
by abstract
using abstract
(1) abstract
data-driven abstract
learning abstract
and abstract
(2) abstract
robustness abstract
of abstract
connectionist abstract
+L+ other
networks. abstract
In abstract
order abstract
to abstract
test abstract
this abstract
approach, abstract
we abstract
have abstract
developed abstract
the abstract
screen abstract
system abstract
which abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
based abstract
on abstract
this abstract
new abstract
robust, abstract
learned abstract
and abstract
flat abstract
analysis. abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
focus abstract
on abstract
a abstract
detailed abstract
description abstract
of abstract
screen's abstract
architecture, abstract
the abstract
flat abstract
+L+ other
syntactic abstract
and abstract
semantic abstract
analysis, abstract
the abstract
interaction abstract
with abstract
a abstract
speech abstract
recognizer, abstract
and abstract
a abstract

+L+ other
evaluation abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
the abstract
robustness abstract
under abstract
the abstract
influence abstract
of abstract
noisy abstract
or abstract
incomplete abstract
input. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
main abstract
result abstract
of abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
is abstract
that abstract
flat abstract
representations abstract
allow abstract
more abstract
robust abstract
processing abstract
of abstract
+L+ other

This abstract
paper abstract
presents abstract
a abstract
comprehensive abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
model-based abstract
diagnosis abstract
which abstract
includes abstract
proposals abstract
for abstract
characterizing abstract
and abstract
computing abstract
preferred abstract
diagnoses, abstract
assuming abstract
that abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
description abstract
is abstract
augmented abstract
with abstract
a abstract
system abstract
structure abstract
(a abstract
directed abstract
graph abstract
explicating abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
interconnections abstract
between abstract
system abstract
components). abstract
Specifically, abstract
we abstract
first abstract
introduce abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
consequence, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
a abstract
syntactically abstract
unconstrained abstract
propositional abstract
sentence abstract
that abstract
characterizes abstract
all abstract
consistency-based abstract
diagnoses abstract
and abstract
show abstract
that abstract
standard abstract
characterizations abstract
of abstract
diagnoses, abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
minimal abstract
conflicts, abstract
correspond abstract
to abstract
syntactic abstract
variations abstract
on abstract
a abstract
consequence. abstract
Second, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
syntactic abstract
variation abstract
on abstract
the abstract
consequence abstract
known abstract
as abstract
negation abstract
normal abstract
form abstract
+L+ other
(NNF) abstract
and abstract
discuss abstract
its abstract
merits abstract
compared abstract
to abstract
standard abstract
variations. abstract
Third, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
basic abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
for abstract
computing abstract
consequences abstract
in abstract
NNF abstract
given abstract
a abstract
structured abstract
system abstract
description. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
show abstract
that abstract
if abstract
the abstract
system abstract
structure abstract
does abstract
not abstract
contain abstract
cycles, abstract
then abstract
there abstract
is abstract
always abstract
a abstract
linear-size abstract
+L+ other
consequence abstract
in abstract
NNF abstract
which abstract
can abstract
be abstract
computed abstract
in abstract
linear abstract
time. abstract
For abstract
arbitrary abstract
system abstract
structures, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
a abstract
precise abstract
connection abstract
between abstract
the abstract
complexity abstract
of abstract
computing abstract
consequences abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
the abstract
topology abstract
of abstract
the abstract
underlying abstract
system abstract
structure. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
an abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
enumerates abstract
the abstract
preferred abstract
diagnoses abstract
characterized abstract
by abstract
a abstract
consequence. abstract
The abstract
algorithm abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
shown abstract
to abstract
take abstract
linear abstract
time abstract
in abstract

size abstract
of abstract
the abstract
consequence abstract
if abstract
the abstract

satisfies abstract

The abstract
complexity abstract
of abstract
parallel abstract
applications abstract
and abstract
parallel abstract
processor abstract
scheduling abstract
policies abstract
makes abstract
both abstract
exact abstract
analysis abstract
and abstract
simulation abstract
difficult, abstract
if abstract
not abstract
intractable, abstract
for abstract
large abstract
systems. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
approach abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
performance abstract
modeling abstract
of abstract
multiprogrammed abstract
processor abstract
scheduling abstract
policies, abstract
that abstract
of abstract
interpolation abstract

We abstract
first abstract
define abstract
a abstract
workload abstract
model abstract
that abstract
contains abstract
parameters abstract
for abstract
the abstract
essential abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
parallel abstract
+L+ other
applications abstract
with abstract
respect abstract
to abstract
scheduling abstract
discipline abstract
performance, abstract
yet abstract
lends abstract
itself abstract
to abstract
mathematical abstract
analysis. abstract
Key abstract
+L+ other
features abstract
of abstract
the abstract

include abstract
general abstract

+L+ other
of abstract

parallelism, abstract
and abstract
a abstract

We abstract
then abstract
show abstract
that abstract
one abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
find abstract
specific abstract
values abstract
of abstract
the abstract
system abstract
parameters abstract
for abstract
which abstract
the abstract
parallel abstract

under abstract

given abstract
scheduling abstract
+L+ other
policy abstract
reduces abstract
to abstract
a abstract
queueing abstract
system abstract
with abstract
a abstract

(closed-form) abstract
solution. abstract
Finally, abstract
interpolation abstract
between abstract
+L+ other

is abstract
used abstract

arrive abstract

The abstract

and abstract
are abstract

We abstract
illustrate abstract
the abstract
approach abstract

We abstract

results abstract
obtained abstract
from abstract
the abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
the abstract
three abstract

One abstract

makes abstract
two abstract
contributions abstract

area: abstract
+L+ other
* abstract
The abstract
first abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
experiments abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
explore abstract
the abstract
trade-offs abstract
between abstract
techniques abstract
previously abstract
defined abstract
by abstract
Lars abstract
Andersen abstract
and abstract
Bjarne abstract
Steens-gaard. abstract
The abstract
former abstract
has abstract
a abstract
cubic abstract
worst-case abstract
running abstract
+L+ other
time, abstract
while abstract
the abstract
latter abstract
is abstract
essentially abstract
linear. abstract
However, abstract
the abstract
former abstract
may abstract
be abstract
much abstract
more abstract
precise abstract
than abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
latter. abstract
We abstract
have abstract
found abstract
that abstract
in abstract
practice, abstract
Ander-sen's abstract
algorithm abstract
is abstract
consistently abstract
more abstract
precise abstract
than abstract
+L+ other
Steensgaard's. abstract
For abstract
small abstract
programs, abstract
there abstract
is abstract
very abstract
+L+ other
little abstract
difference abstract
in abstract
the abstract
times abstract
required abstract
by abstract
the abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
approaches; abstract
however, abstract
for abstract
larger abstract
programs, abstract
Ander-sen's abstract
algorithm abstract
can abstract
be abstract
much abstract
slower abstract
than abstract
Steens abstract
+L+ other
gaard's. abstract
+L+ other
* abstract
The abstract
second abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
the abstract
definition abstract
of abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
new abstract
algorithms. abstract
The abstract
first abstract

can abstract

the abstract

two. abstract

The abstract
second abstract
algorithm abstract
uses abstract
the abstract
first abstract
as abstract
a abstract

Its abstract
worst-case abstract

+L+ other

However, abstract
the abstract
decision abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
what abstract
and abstract
how abstract
much abstract
to abstract
precompute abstract
is abstract
a abstract
difficult abstract
one. abstract
It abstract
is abstract
further abstract

the abstract
fact abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
precomputation abstract
in abstract
the abstract

the abstract

Hence, abstract
it abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
+L+ other
three abstract
strategies abstract
for abstract
this abstract
problem: abstract
one abstract
based abstract
on abstract
+L+ other
sampling, abstract
one abstract
based abstract
on abstract
mathematical abstract

and abstract
one abstract
based abstract
on abstract
probabilistic abstract
counting. abstract
We abstract
investigate abstract
the abstract
accuracy abstract
of abstract
these abstract
algorithms abstract
in abstract
estimating abstract
the abstract
blowup abstract
for abstract
different abstract
+L+ other
data abstract
distributions abstract
and abstract
database abstract
schemas. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
based abstract
upon abstract
probabilistic abstract

is abstract
+L+ other
particularly abstract
attractive, abstract
since abstract
it abstract

We abstract
present abstract
a abstract
technique abstract
to abstract
study abstract
relations abstract
between abstract
weak abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
strong abstract
fi-normalisations abstract
in abstract

We abstract
first abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
translation abstract
which abstract
translates abstract
a abstract
-term abstract
into abstract
a abstract
I-term, abstract
and abstract
show abstract
that abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
-term abstract
is abstract
strongly abstract
fi-normalisable abstract
if abstract
and abstract
only abstract
if abstract
its abstract
translation abstract
is abstract
weakly abstract
+L+ other
fi-normalisable. abstract
We abstract
then abstract
prove abstract
that abstract
the abstract
translation abstract
preserves abstract
typability abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
-terms abstract
in abstract
various abstract
typed abstract
-calculi. abstract
This abstract
enables abstract
us abstract
to abstract
establish abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
equivalence abstract
between abstract
weak abstract
and abstract
strong abstract
fi-normalisations abstract
in abstract
these abstract
typed abstract

that abstract
supports abstract

While abstract

models abstract
remove abstract

our abstract

a abstract

what abstract

a abstract

to abstract
a abstract

arbitrarily abstract

The abstract
abstraction abstract
operator, abstract
which abstract

Abstract abstract

The abstract
Finite-State abstract
Markov abstract
Channel abstract
(FSMC) abstract
is abstract
a abstract
discrete-time abstract
varying abstract
channel abstract
whose abstract
variation abstract
is abstract
determined abstract
by abstract
a abstract
finite-state abstract
Markov abstract
process. abstract
These abstract
channels abstract
have abstract
memory abstract
due abstract
to abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
Markov abstract
channel abstract
variation. abstract
We abstract
obtain abstract
the abstract
FSMC abstract
capacity abstract
as abstract
a abstract
function abstract
of abstract
the abstract
conditional abstract
channel abstract
+L+ other
state abstract
probability. abstract
We abstract
also abstract
show abstract
that abstract
for abstract
i.i.d. abstract
channel abstract
inputs, abstract
this abstract
conditional abstract
probability abstract
converges abstract
+L+ other
weakly, abstract
and abstract
the abstract
channel's abstract
mutual abstract
information abstract
is abstract
then abstract
a abstract

continuous abstract
function abstract

We abstract
next abstract
consider abstract
coding abstract
for abstract

In abstract
general, abstract
the abstract
complexity abstract
of abstract
maximum-likelihood abstract
+L+ other
decoding abstract
grows abstract
exponentially abstract
with abstract
the abstract
channel abstract
memory abstract
length. abstract
Therefore, abstract
in abstract
practice, abstract
interleaving abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
memoryless abstract
channel abstract
codes abstract
are abstract
used. abstract
This abstract
technique abstract
results abstract
in abstract
some abstract

+L+ other

the abstract
inherent abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract

with abstract

that abstract
is abstract
independent abstract

We abstract

Abstract. abstract
The abstract
simple abstract
Bayesian abstract

is abstract
known abstract
to abstract
be abstract
optimal abstract
when abstract
attributes abstract
are abstract
independent abstract
+L+ other
given abstract
the abstract
class, abstract
but abstract
the abstract
question abstract
of abstract
whether abstract
other abstract
sufficient abstract
conditions abstract
for abstract
its abstract
optimality abstract
exist abstract
has abstract
+L+ other
so abstract
far abstract
not abstract
been abstract
explored. abstract
Empirical abstract
results abstract
showing abstract
that abstract
it abstract
performs abstract
surprisingly abstract
well abstract
in abstract
many abstract
+L+ other
domains abstract
containing abstract
clear abstract
attribute abstract

suggest abstract
that abstract
the abstract
answer abstract
to abstract
this abstract
question abstract
may abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
positive. abstract
This abstract
article abstract
shows abstract
that, abstract
although abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
classifier's abstract
probability abstract
estimates abstract
are abstract
only abstract
+L+ other
optimal abstract
under abstract
quadratic abstract
loss abstract
if abstract
the abstract

the abstract

itself abstract
can abstract

(misclassification abstract

even abstract
when abstract
this abstract

The abstract
region abstract

of abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
classifier abstract
is abstract
in abstract
fact abstract
a abstract
second-order abstract
infinitesimal abstract
fraction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
region abstract
of abstract
zero-one abstract
optimality. abstract
This abstract
implies abstract
that abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
+L+ other
classifier abstract
has abstract
a abstract
much abstract
greater abstract
range abstract
of abstract
applicability abstract
than abstract
previously abstract
thought. abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
in abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
article abstract
it abstract
is abstract
shown abstract
to abstract
be abstract
optimal abstract
for abstract
learning abstract
conjunctions abstract
and abstract
disjunctions, abstract
even abstract
though abstract
they abstract
+L+ other
violate abstract
the abstract
independence abstract
assumption. abstract
Further, abstract
studies abstract
in abstract
artificial abstract
domains abstract
show abstract
that abstract
it abstract
will abstract
often abstract
+L+ other
outperform abstract
more abstract
powerful abstract
classifiers abstract
for abstract

if abstract
its abstract

is abstract
a abstract

to abstract
the abstract
domain. abstract
This abstract

results abstract
also abstract

that abstract

Speech abstract
disfluencies abstract
(such abstract

are abstract
+L+ other
among abstract
the abstract

spontaneous abstract
speech abstract
from abstract
+L+ other
planned abstract

We abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
language abstract
model abstract
that abstract
predicts abstract
disfluencies abstract
probabilistically abstract
and abstract
uses abstract
an abstract

The abstract
model abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract

the abstract

It abstract
uses abstract

the abstract
probability abstract
of abstract
a abstract
word abstract
sequence, abstract
taking abstract

+L+ other
account abstract

We abstract
analyze abstract
the abstract
model's abstract
performance abstract
for abstract
various abstract
disfluency abstract
types abstract
on abstract
the abstract
Switchboard abstract

corpus. abstract
We abstract
find abstract
that abstract
the abstract
model abstract
reduces abstract

perplexity abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
neighborhood abstract
of abstract
disfluency abstract
events; abstract
however, abstract
overall abstract

+L+ other
are abstract

have abstract
no abstract

We abstract

The abstract

In abstract

we abstract

Clearly, abstract

The abstract
key abstract

in abstract
their abstract
performance abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
efficient abstract
query abstract
planning abstract
that abstract
minimizes abstract
the abstract
number abstract

used abstract
to abstract
answer abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
query. abstract
Previous abstract
work abstract
on abstract

has abstract
considered abstract
generating abstract
information abstract
gathering abstract
+L+ other
plans abstract
solely abstract
based abstract
on abstract
compile-time abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
the abstract
query abstract
and abstract
the abstract
models abstract
of abstract
the abstract
information abstract
+L+ other
sources. abstract
We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
at abstract
compile-time abstract
it abstract
may abstract
not abstract
be abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
generate abstract
an abstract
efficient abstract
+L+ other
plan abstract
for abstract
retrieving abstract
the abstract
requested abstract
information abstract
because abstract
of abstract
the abstract
large abstract
number abstract
of abstract
possibly abstract
+L+ other

sources. abstract
We abstract
describe abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
that abstract
naturally abstract
extends abstract
query abstract
planning abstract
to abstract
use abstract
+L+ other
run-time abstract
information abstract
to abstract
optimize abstract
queries abstract
that abstract
involve abstract
many abstract
sources. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
for abstract
generating abstract
a abstract
discrimination abstract
matrix, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
a abstract
data abstract
structure abstract
that abstract
identifies abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
information abstract
that abstract
can abstract
be abstract
sensed abstract
at abstract
run-time abstract
to abstract
optimize abstract
a abstract
query abstract
plan. abstract
Next, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
+L+ other
how abstract
the abstract
discrimination abstract
matrix abstract
is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
decide abstract
which abstract
of abstract
the abstract
possible abstract
run-time abstract
sensing abstract
+L+ other
actions abstract
to abstract
perform. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
this abstract
approach abstract
yields abstract
significant abstract

The abstract

Such abstract

We abstract

there abstract

any abstract

is abstract
NP-hard. abstract
However, abstract
if abstract
the abstract

then abstract
there abstract
exists abstract
a abstract

them abstract
which abstract

Although abstract

Furthermore, abstract

several abstract

We abstract
evaluate abstract

a abstract

The abstract

process abstract
consists abstract
of abstract
obtaining abstract
accurate abstract
estimates abstract
of abstract
the abstract

of abstract
alternative abstract

models. abstract
We abstract
evaluate abstract
experimentally abstract
four abstract
methods abstract
for abstract
obtaining abstract
these abstract
estimates abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
twelve abstract
domains. abstract
The abstract
goal abstract
of abstract
this abstract
evaluation abstract
was abstract
to abstract
characterise abstract
the abstract
performance abstract

the abstract

in abstract
the abstract

The abstract

The abstract

We abstract

such abstract

employed abstract
+L+ other
by abstract
the abstract

Our abstract
main abstract
result abstract
is abstract
a abstract
proof abstract
that abstract
such abstract
algorithms abstract
+L+ other
are abstract
boosting abstract
algorithms. abstract
By abstract
this abstract
we abstract
mean abstract
that abstract
if abstract
the abstract

that abstract
label abstract
the abstract
internal abstract
nodes abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
decision abstract
tree abstract
can abstract
weakly abstract
approximate abstract
the abstract
unknown abstract
target abstract
function, abstract
then abstract
the abstract
top-down abstract

we abstract
+L+ other
study abstract
will abstract
amplify abstract
this abstract
weak abstract
advantage abstract
to abstract
build abstract
a abstract
tree abstract
achieving abstract
any abstract
desired abstract
level abstract
of abstract
accuracy. abstract
The abstract
bounds abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
obtain abstract
for abstract
this abstract
amplification abstract
show abstract
an abstract
interesting abstract
dependence abstract
on abstract
the abstract
splitting abstract
criterion abstract
used abstract
by abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
top-down abstract
algorithm. abstract
More abstract
precisely, abstract
if abstract
the abstract
functions abstract
used abstract
to abstract
label abstract
the abstract
internal abstract
nodes abstract
have abstract
error abstract
1=2 abstract
+L+ other
as abstract
approximations abstract
to abstract
the abstract

then abstract
for abstract
the abstract

Thus abstract
(for abstract

a abstract

amplified abstract

+L+ other

For abstract
a abstract

is abstract
obtained, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
provably abstract
optimal abstract
for abstract
decision abstract
+L+ other
tree abstract
algorithms. abstract
The abstract

This abstract

The abstract

The abstract
domain abstract
of abstract
applications abstract
that abstract
can abstract
be abstract
created abstract
with abstract
programming-by-demonstration abstract
+L+ other
(PBD) abstract
can abstract
be abstract
extended abstract
by abstract
improving abstract
the abstract
developers abstract
ability abstract
to abstract
communicate abstract
with abstract
the abstract
system. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
techniques abstract
provided abstract
in abstract
this abstract
thesis abstract
will abstract
allow abstract
nonprogrammers abstract
to abstract
create abstract
a abstract
new abstract
variety abstract
of abstract
complete, abstract
+L+ other
interactive abstract
applications abstract
including abstract
many abstract
board abstract
games abstract
and abstract
educational abstract
software abstract
using abstract
PBD. abstract
+L+ other
A abstract
PBD abstract
software abstract
tool abstract
uses abstract
inferencing abstract
to abstract
induce abstract
programs abstract
by abstract
watching abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
demonstrate abstract
examples abstract
that abstract
show abstract
how abstract
the abstract
application abstract
should abstract
behave. abstract
Current abstract
systems abstract
reduce abstract
their abstract
scope abstract
+L+ other
or abstract
resort abstract
to abstract
having abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
program abstract
because abstract
they abstract
do abstract
not abstract
provide abstract
sufficient abstract
ways abstract
to abstract
express abstract
+L+ other
behaviors abstract
and abstract
the abstract
factors abstract
that abstract
affect abstract
them. abstract
Therefore, abstract
the abstract
goal abstract
of abstract
this abstract
thesis abstract
is abstract
to abstract
develop abstract
understandable abstract
forms abstract
of abstract
annotated abstract
expression abstract
and abstract
manipulation abstract
that abstract
help abstract
a abstract
system abstract
infer abstract
a abstract
broader abstract
range abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
behavior. abstract
To abstract
test abstract
these abstract
ideas, abstract
this abstract
proposal abstract
introduces abstract
a abstract
new abstract
system abstract
called abstract
Gamut abstract
that abstract
will abstract
+L+ other
present abstract
the abstract
techniques abstract
in abstract
a abstract
unified abstract
software abstract
tool. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
first abstract
technique abstract
replaces abstract
the abstract
macro abstract
recorder abstract
method abstract
for abstract
demonstrating abstract
behavior abstract
used abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
other abstract
PBD abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
a abstract
technique abstract
called abstract
nudges. abstract
The abstract
developer abstract
demonstrates abstract
by abstract
correcting abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
system abstract
at abstract
important abstract
points abstract
during abstract
program abstract
execution abstract
and abstract
also abstract
using abstract
two abstract
nudge abstract
commands abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
communicate abstract
important abstract
situations. abstract
First, abstract
the abstract
Do abstract
Something! abstract
nudge abstract
causes abstract
the abstract
system abstract
to abstract
reconsider abstract
+L+ other
past abstract
learned abstract
behavior abstract
and abstract
try abstract
to abstract
generalize abstract
its abstract
knowledge abstract
to abstract
fit abstract
the abstract
current abstract
situation. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
Stop abstract
That! abstract
nudge abstract
will abstract
point abstract
out abstract
improper abstract
behavior abstract
and abstract
generate abstract
negative abstract
examples. abstract
+L+ other
Second, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
use abstract
a abstract
new abstract
deck-of-playing-cards abstract
metaphor abstract
to abstract
express abstract
concepts abstract
such abstract
+L+ other
as abstract
randomness, abstract
sequencing, abstract
and abstract
data abstract
storage. abstract
By abstract
constructing abstract
an abstract
appropriate abstract
deck, abstract
shufing, abstract
sorting, abstract
and abstract
playing abstract
cards abstract
at abstract
key abstract
moments, abstract
developers abstract
can abstract
incorporate abstract
many abstract
effects abstract
not abstract
available abstract
without abstract
programming abstract
in abstract
other abstract
systems. abstract
+L+ other
Third, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
improve abstract
communication abstract
about abstract
behaviors abstract
by abstract
making abstract
them abstract
more abstract
manipulable abstract
than abstract
in abstract
previous abstract
systems. abstract
Behaviors abstract
will abstract
be abstract
represented abstract
as abstract
small abstract
icons abstract
near abstract
the abstract
objects abstract
they abstract
+L+ other
affect. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
familiar abstract
cut, abstract
copy, abstract
and abstract
paste abstract
commands, abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
can abstract
transfer abstract
behavior abstract
+L+ other
between abstract
objects. abstract
Determining abstract
how abstract
to abstract
make abstract
a abstract
behavior abstract
operate abstract
in abstract
the abstract
new abstract
context abstract
will abstract
be abstract
inferred abstract
+L+ other
automatically. abstract
An abstract
objects abstract
state abstract
from abstract
the abstract
recent abstract
past abstract
will abstract
be abstract
represented abstract
as abstract
temporal abstract
ghosts abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
objects abstract
become abstract
dimmed, abstract
translucent abstract
images. abstract
Many abstract
sorts abstract
of abstract
behavior abstract
refer abstract
to abstract
prior abstract
states abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
a abstract
previous abstract
position abstract
or abstract
an abstract
old abstract
property abstract
value. abstract
The abstract
ghost abstract
objects abstract
will abstract
allow abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
make abstract
explicit abstract
connections. abstract
+L+ other
Finally, abstract
to abstract
reduce abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
options abstract
the abstract
system abstract
must abstract
explore, abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
will abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
able abstract
to abstract
give abstract
hints abstract
by abstract
highlighting abstract
important abstract
objects abstract
and abstract
properties. abstract
A abstract
new abstract
inferencing abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
will abstract
be abstract
created abstract
that abstract
will abstract
take abstract
advantage abstract
of abstract
the abstract
hints. abstract

By abstract
combining abstract
these abstract
techniques, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
provide abstract
a abstract
rich abstract
medium abstract
for abstract

greater abstract

the abstract

Abstract abstract
We abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
new abstract
kind abstract
of abstract
language abstract
model, abstract
which abstract
models abstract
whole abstract
sentences abstract
or abstract
utterances abstract
directly abstract
using abstract
the abstract
Maximum abstract
Entropy abstract
+L+ other
paradigm. abstract
The abstract
new abstract
model abstract
is abstract
conceptually abstract
simpler, abstract
and abstract
more abstract
naturally abstract
+L+ other
suited abstract
to abstract
modeling abstract
whole-sentence abstract
phenomena, abstract
than abstract
the abstract
conditional abstract
ME abstract
+L+ other
models abstract
proposed abstract
to abstract
date. abstract
By abstract
avoiding abstract
the abstract
chain abstract
rule, abstract
the abstract
model abstract
treats abstract
+L+ other
each abstract
sentence abstract
or abstract
utterance abstract
as abstract
a abstract
"bag abstract
of abstract
features", abstract
where abstract
features abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
arbitrary abstract
computable abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
sentence. abstract
The abstract
model abstract
is abstract
unnor-malizable, abstract
but abstract
this abstract
does abstract
not abstract
interfere abstract
with abstract
training abstract
(done abstract
via abstract
sampling) abstract
+L+ other
or abstract
with abstract
use. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
model abstract
is abstract
computationally abstract
straightforward. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
main abstract

cost abstract
of abstract
training abstract
the abstract
model abstract
is abstract
in abstract
generating abstract
sample abstract
+L+ other
sentences abstract
from abstract
a abstract
Gibbs abstract
distribution. abstract
Interestingly, abstract
this abstract
cost abstract
has abstract
different abstract
dependencies, abstract
and abstract
is abstract
potentially abstract
lower, abstract
than abstract
in abstract
the abstract

has abstract
produced abstract
two abstract

for abstract

grid-based abstract
and abstract

While abstract

their abstract
complexity abstract
often abstract

Topological abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
describes abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
that abstract
integrates abstract
both abstract
paradigms: abstract
grid-based abstract

topological. abstract
Grid-based abstract

Topological abstract

partitioning abstract
the abstract

Two abstract
sets abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
assumptions abstract
have abstract
to abstract
be abstract
made: abstract
(1) abstract
What abstract
is abstract
a abstract
trade? abstract
We abstract
define abstract
a abstract
trade abstract
to abstract
begin abstract
when abstract
an abstract
account abstract
opens abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
position, abstract
and abstract
to abstract
end abstract
when abstract
its abstract
position abstract
size abstract
returns abstract
to abstract
zero. abstract
We abstract
describe abstract
each abstract
trade abstract
by abstract
several abstract
trade-specific abstract
variables abstract
(e.g., abstract
length abstract
of abstract
trade, abstract
maximum abstract
position abstract
size, abstract
opening abstract

long abstract
or abstract
short) abstract
and abstract
several abstract
+L+ other
exogenous, abstract
market-specific abstract
variables abstract
(e.g., abstract
price, abstract
volatility, abstract

volume). abstract
(2) abstract
What abstract
process abstract

+L+ other
the abstract
data? abstract
We abstract
assume abstract
a abstract

An abstract
observed abstract

realization abstract

+L+ other
one abstract

components. abstract
This abstract
paper abstract
assumes abstract
identity abstract
covariance abstract
matrices. abstract
Furthermore, abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
trade abstract
is abstract
fully abstract
assigned abstract
to abstract
a abstract
single abstract
cluster. abstract
We abstract
compare abstract
this abstract
approach abstract

Using abstract

we abstract

them abstract

Unity abstract

introduced abstract

Chandy abstract

Misra. abstract
The abstract
Unity abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
to abstract
refine abstract
specifications. abstract
Although abstract
it abstract
has abstract
proven abstract
a abstract
suitable abstract
formalism abstract
for abstract
deriving abstract
+L+ other
algorithms, abstract
it abstract
seems abstract
less abstract
suitable abstract
for abstract

Following abstract
Sanders abstract

Singh, abstract
we abstract
formalize abstract
program abstract
refinement abstract
in abstract
the abstract
Unity abstract
framework abstract
as abstract
the abstract
preservation abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
Unity abstract
properties. abstract
We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
Unity abstract
properties abstract
are abstract
not abstract
powerful abstract
enough abstract
to abstract
characterize abstract
execution abstract
sequences. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
consequence, abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
property-preserving abstract
refinement abstract
+L+ other
differs abstract
from abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
reducing abstract
