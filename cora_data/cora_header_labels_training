provides abstract
a abstract
good abstract
way abstract

abstracting abstract
out abstract
various abstract
aspects abstract

Using abstract
an abstract

We abstract
propose abstract

Computation abstract
+L+ other

suspending abstract

running abstract
an abstract

Threads abstract
naturally abstract

Threads abstract
are abstract

Thus abstract
data-parallelism abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
supported. abstract
Since abstract

We abstract
present abstract
a abstract
new abstract
symbolic abstract
model abstract
checking abstract
technique, abstract
which abstract
analyzes abstract
temporal abstract
properties abstract
in abstract
multi-typed abstract
transition abstract
systems. abstract
Specifically, abstract
the abstract
method abstract
uses abstract
multiple abstract
type-specific abstract
data abstract
encodings abstract
to abstract
represent abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
states, abstract
and abstract
it abstract
carries abstract
out abstract
fixpoint abstract
computations abstract
via abstract
the abstract
corresponding abstract
type-specific abstract
symbolic abstract
+L+ other
operations. abstract
In abstract
essence, abstract
different abstract
symbolic abstract
encodings abstract
are abstract
unified abstract
into abstract
one abstract
composite abstract
model abstract
checker. abstract
Any abstract
+L+ other
type-specific abstract

can abstract
be abstract
included abstract
in abstract
this abstract
framework abstract
provided abstract
that abstract
the abstract
language abstract
is abstract
closed abstract
under abstract
+L+ other
Boolean abstract

can abstract
be abstract
checked abstract
for abstract
satisfiability, abstract
and abstract
relational abstract

Our abstract
technique abstract
relies abstract
on abstract
conjunctive abstract
partitioning abstract
of abstract
transition abstract
relations abstract
of abstract
atomic abstract
events abstract
based abstract
on abstract
variable abstract
+L+ other
types abstract

which abstract
allows abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
our abstract
method abstract
on abstract
a abstract
nontrivial abstract
data-transfer abstract
protocol, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
contains abstract
a abstract
mixture abstract
of abstract
integer abstract
and abstract
Boolean-valued abstract
variables. abstract
The abstract
protocol abstract
operates abstract
over abstract
an abstract
unreliable abstract
channel abstract
that abstract
can abstract
lose, abstract
duplicate abstract
or abstract
reorder abstract
messages. abstract
Moreover, abstract
the abstract
protocol's abstract

rather, abstract

The abstract
key abstract

in abstract

is abstract
+L+ other
efficient abstract
query abstract
planning abstract
that abstract
minimizes abstract
the abstract
number abstract

+L+ other

Previous abstract
work abstract
on abstract

has abstract
considered abstract
generating abstract
information abstract
gathering abstract
+L+ other

solely abstract
based abstract
on abstract
compile-time abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
the abstract
query abstract
and abstract
the abstract
models abstract
of abstract
the abstract
information abstract
+L+ other
sources. abstract
We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
at abstract
compile-time abstract
it abstract
may abstract
not abstract
be abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
generate abstract
an abstract
efficient abstract
+L+ other
plan abstract
for abstract
retrieving abstract
the abstract
requested abstract
information abstract
because abstract
of abstract
the abstract
large abstract
number abstract

possibly abstract

We abstract
describe abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
that abstract
naturally abstract
extends abstract
query abstract
planning abstract
to abstract
use abstract
+L+ other
run-time abstract
information abstract
to abstract
optimize abstract
queries abstract
that abstract
involve abstract
many abstract
sources. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
for abstract
generating abstract
a abstract
discrimination abstract
matrix, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
a abstract
data abstract
structure abstract
that abstract
identifies abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
information abstract
that abstract
can abstract
be abstract
sensed abstract
at abstract
run-time abstract
to abstract
optimize abstract
a abstract
query abstract
plan. abstract
Next, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
+L+ other
how abstract
the abstract
discrimination abstract
matrix abstract
is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
decide abstract
which abstract
of abstract
the abstract
possible abstract
run-time abstract
sensing abstract
+L+ other
actions abstract
to abstract
perform. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
this abstract
approach abstract
yields abstract
significant abstract

Summary abstract
+L+ other
This abstract
article abstract
presents abstract
a abstract
software-only abstract
solution abstract
to abstract
the abstract
synchronization abstract
problem abstract
for abstract
uniprocessors. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
idea abstract
is abstract
to abstract
execute abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
without abstract
any abstract
hardware abstract
protection, abstract
and abstract
in abstract
the abstract
rare abstract
case abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
pre-emption, abstract
to abstract
roll abstract
the abstract
sequence abstract
forward abstract
to abstract
the abstract
end, abstract
thereby abstract
preserving abstract
atomicity. abstract
One abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
proposed abstract
implementations abstract
protects abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
without abstract
any abstract
memory-accesses. abstract
This abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
significant abstract
as abstract
it abstract
enables abstract
execution abstract
at abstract
CPU-speeds, abstract
rather abstract
than abstract
memory-speeds. abstract
The abstract
benefit abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
this abstract
method abstract
increases abstract
with abstract
the abstract
frequency abstract
at abstract
which abstract
atomic abstract
sequences abstract
are abstract
executed. abstract
It abstract
therefore abstract
+L+ other
encourages abstract
the abstract
building abstract
of abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
fine-grained abstract
synchronization. abstract
This abstract
has abstract
the abstract
additional abstract
+L+ other
advantage abstract
of abstract
reducing abstract
average abstract
latency. abstract
Experiments abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
this abstract
technique abstract
has abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
potential abstract
to abstract
outperform abstract
even abstract
the abstract
best abstract
hardware abstract
mechanisms. abstract
The abstract
main abstract
contribution abstract
of abstract
this abstract
article abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
to abstract
discuss abstract
operating-system abstract
related abstract

of abstract

Abstract abstract

We abstract
examine abstract
the abstract
estimation abstract
of abstract
selectivities abstract
for abstract
range abstract
and abstract
spatial abstract
join abstract

in abstract
real abstract
spatial abstract
+L+ other

As abstract
we abstract
have abstract

earlier abstract
[FK94a], abstract
real abstract
point abstract
sets: abstract
(a) abstract
violate abstract
consistently abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
"uniformity" abstract
and abstract
"independence" abstract
assumptions, abstract
(b) abstract
can abstract
often abstract
be abstract
described abstract
as abstract
"fractals", abstract
with abstract
+L+ other
non-integer abstract
(fractal) abstract
dimension. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
show abstract
that, abstract
among abstract
the abstract
infinite abstract
family abstract
of abstract
fractal abstract
+L+ other
dimensions, abstract
the abstract
so abstract
called abstract
"Correlation abstract
Dimension" abstract
D abstract

is abstract
the abstract
one abstract
that abstract
we abstract
need abstract
to abstract
predict abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
selectivity abstract

spatial abstract

+L+ other
The abstract
main abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
that, abstract
for abstract
all abstract
the abstract
real abstract
and abstract
synthetic abstract
point-sets abstract
we abstract
tried, abstract
the abstract
average abstract

given abstract
point abstract
of abstract
the abstract
point-set abstract
follows abstract
a abstract

with abstract
D abstract
2 abstract
as abstract
the abstract
exponent. abstract
This abstract
immediately abstract
solves abstract
the abstract
selectivity abstract
estimation abstract
for abstract
spatial abstract
joins, abstract
as abstract
well abstract
as abstract
for abstract
"biased" abstract
+L+ other
range abstract
queries abstract
(i.e., abstract
queries abstract
whose abstract
centers abstract
prefer abstract
areas abstract
of abstract
high abstract

density). abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
present abstract
the abstract
formulas abstract
to abstract
estimate abstract
the abstract

the abstract

queries, abstract
including abstract
an abstract
integration abstract
constant abstract
(K abstract
`shape abstract

for abstract
each abstract

Finally, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
results abstract
on abstract
real abstract
and abstract
synthetic abstract
+L+ other
point abstract

where abstract
our abstract

achieve abstract
very abstract

Abstract abstract

In abstract
the abstract
past abstract

there abstract
has abstract
been abstract
an abstract
increasing abstract
interest abstract
in abstract
workflow abstract

as abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
way abstract
of abstract
supporting abstract
complex abstract

in abstract

Given abstract
the abstract
nature abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
the abstract
environment abstract
and abstract
the abstract
technology abstract
involved, abstract
workflow abstract
applications abstract
are abstract
inherently abstract
+L+ other
distributed abstract
and abstract
pose abstract
many abstract
interesting abstract
challenges abstract
to abstract
the abstract
system abstract
designer. abstract
In abstract
most abstract
cases, abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
client/server abstract
architecture abstract
is abstract
used abstract
in abstract
which abstract
knowledge abstract
about abstract
the abstract

executed abstract

+L+ other
centralized abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
explore abstract
a abstract
novel abstract

Exotica/FMQM, abstract
for abstract
workflow abstract
+L+ other
systems abstract
in abstract
which abstract
the abstract
need abstract
for abstract
such abstract
a abstract

Instead, abstract
we abstract
use abstract
+L+ other
persistent abstract
messages abstract
as abstract
the abstract
means abstract
to abstract
store abstract
the abstract
information abstract
relevant abstract
to abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
of abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
business abstract
process. abstract
Our abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
to abstract
completely abstract
distribute abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
of abstract
a abstract
process abstract
so abstract
+L+ other
individual abstract
nodes abstract
are abstract
independent. abstract
The abstract
advantages abstract
of abstract
this abstract
approach abstract
are abstract
increased abstract

+L+ other

However, abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
1972, abstract
Reynolds abstract
outlined abstract
a abstract
general abstract
method abstract
for abstract
eliminating abstract
functional abstract
arguments abstract
known abstract
as abstract
defunctionalization. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
idea abstract
underlying abstract
defunctionalization abstract
is abstract
encoding abstract
functional abstract
+L+ other
values abstract
as abstract
first-order abstract
data, abstract
and abstract
then abstract
to abstract
realized abstract
the abstract
applications abstract
of abstract
the abstract
encoded abstract
function abstract
via abstract
an abstract
apply abstract
function. abstract
Although abstract
this abstract
process abstract
is abstract
simple abstract
enough, abstract
problems abstract
arise abstract
when abstract
+L+ other
defunctionalization abstract
is abstract
used abstract
in abstract
a abstract
polymorphic abstract
language. abstract
In abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
a abstract
language, abstract
a abstract
functional abstract
argument abstract
of abstract
a abstract
higher-order abstract
+L+ other
function abstract
can abstract
take abstract
different abstract
type abstract
instances abstract
in abstract
different abstract
applications. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
consequence, abstract
its abstract
associated abstract
apply abstract
function abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
untypable abstract
in abstract
the abstract
soucre abstract
language. abstract
In abstract
the abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
present abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
defunctionalization abstract
transformation abstract
which abstract
preserves abstract
typa-bility. abstract
Moreover, abstract
the abstract
transformation abstract
imposes abstract
no abstract
restriction abstract
+L+ other
on abstract
functional abstract
arguments abstract
of abstract
recursive abstract
functions, abstract
and abstract
it abstract
handles abstract
functions abstract
as abstract
results abstract
as abstract
well abstract
as abstract
functions abstract
encapsulated abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
constructors abstract
or abstract
tuples. abstract
The abstract
key abstract
to abstract
this abstract
success abstract
is abstract
the abstract
use abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
type abstract
information abstract
in abstract
the abstract
defunctionalization abstract
transformation. abstract
Run-time abstract
characteristics abstract
are abstract
preserved abstract
by abstract
defunction-alization; abstract
hence, abstract
there abstract
is abstract
no abstract
performance abstract
improvement abstract
coming abstract
from abstract
the abstract

itself. abstract
However abstract
closures abstract
need abstract
+L+ other
not abstract
be abstract
implemented abstract

Since abstract
the abstract

is abstract

+L+ other
it abstract
can abstract
also abstract
easily abstract
perform abstract
a abstract

The abstract

We abstract
present abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
recovering abstract
surface abstract
shape abstract
from abstract
the abstract
occluding abstract
contour abstract
using abstract
an abstract
active abstract
(i.e., abstract
moving) abstract
observer. abstract
It abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract
relation abstract
between abstract
the abstract
geometries abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
surface abstract
in abstract
a abstract
scene abstract
and abstract
its abstract
occluding abstract
contour: abstract
If abstract
the abstract
viewing abstract
direction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
observer abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
along abstract
a abstract
principal abstract
direction abstract
for abstract
a abstract
surface abstract
point abstract
whose abstract
projection abstract
is abstract
on abstract
the abstract
contour, abstract
+L+ other
surface abstract
shape abstract
(i.e., abstract
curvature) abstract
at abstract
the abstract
surface abstract
point abstract
can abstract
be abstract
recovered abstract
from abstract
the abstract
contour. abstract
+L+ other
Unlike abstract
previous abstract
approaches abstract
for abstract
recovering abstract
shape abstract
from abstract
the abstract
occluding abstract
contour, abstract
we abstract
use abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
observer abstract
that abstract
purposefully abstract
changes abstract
viewpoint abstract
in abstract
order abstract
to abstract
achieve abstract
a abstract
well-defined abstract
geometric abstract
relationship abstract
with abstract
respect abstract
to abstract
a abstract
3D abstract
shape abstract
prior abstract
to abstract
its abstract
recognition. abstract
We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
there abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
a abstract
simple abstract
and abstract
efficient abstract
viewing abstract
strategy abstract
that abstract
allows abstract
the abstract
observer abstract
to abstract
align abstract
their abstract
viewing abstract
+L+ other
direction abstract
with abstract
one abstract
of abstract
the abstract
two abstract
principal abstract
directions abstract
for abstract
a abstract
point abstract
on abstract
the abstract
surface. abstract
This abstract
strategy abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
only abstract
curvature abstract
measurements abstract
on abstract
the abstract
occluding abstract
contour abstract
and abstract
therefore abstract
+L+ other
demonstrates abstract
that abstract
recovering abstract
quantitative abstract
shape abstract
information abstract
from abstract
the abstract
contour abstract
does abstract
not abstract
+L+ other
require abstract
knowledge abstract
of abstract
the abstract
velocities abstract
or abstract
accelerations abstract
of abstract
the abstract
observer. abstract
Experimental abstract
results abstract
+L+ other
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
our abstract
method abstract
can abstract
be abstract
easily abstract
implemented abstract
and abstract
can abstract
provide abstract
reliable abstract

Abstract abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
general abstract
framework abstract
for abstract

The abstract
proposed abstract
+L+ other
approach abstract
is abstract
based abstract

It abstract
is abstract
widely abstract

the abstract
new abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
neither abstract

It abstract

the abstract
advantage abstract

tolerating abstract

(unlike abstract

Furthermore, abstract
it abstract

Problems abstract

when abstract
applying abstract
these abstract

The abstract

makes abstract
it abstract
difficult abstract
to abstract
control abstract
the abstract

construction abstract
and abstract
to abstract
assure abstract
that abstract
the abstract
explanations abstract
+L+ other
generated abstract
will abstract
actually abstract

+L+ other
We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
these abstract

can abstract
be abstract
overcome abstract
by abstract
using abstract
goals abstract
and abstract
experience abstract
to abstract
guide abstract
both abstract
+L+ other
explanation abstract
generation abstract
and abstract

Our abstract
work abstract
is abstract
within abstract
the abstract
framework abstract
of abstract
case-based abstract
explanation, abstract
which abstract
builds abstract
explanations abstract
by abstract
retrieving abstract
and abstract
adapting abstract
prior abstract
explanations abstract
stored abstract
in abstract
memory. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
substantiate abstract
our abstract
model abstract
by abstract
describing abstract
mechanisms abstract
that abstract
enable abstract
it abstract
to abstract
effectively abstract
generate abstract
good abstract
+L+ other
explanations. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
demonstrate abstract
that abstract
there abstract
exists abstract
a abstract
theory abstract
of abstract
anomaly abstract
and abstract
explanation abstract
that abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
guide abstract
retrieval abstract
of abstract
relevant abstract
explanations. abstract
Second, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
a abstract
plausibility abstract
evaluation abstract
process abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
efficiently abstract
detects abstract
conflicts abstract
and abstract
confirmations abstract
of abstract
an abstract
explanation's abstract
assumptions abstract
by abstract
prior abstract
patterns, abstract
+L+ other
making abstract
it abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
focus abstract
explanation abstract
adaptation abstract
when abstract
retrieved abstract
explanations abstract
are abstract
implausible. abstract
+L+ other
Third, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
methods abstract
for abstract
judging abstract
whether abstract
explanations abstract
provide abstract
the abstract
information abstract
needed abstract
to abstract
satisfy abstract
explainer abstract
goals abstract
beyond abstract
routine abstract
understanding. abstract
By abstract
reflecting abstract
experience abstract
and abstract
goals abstract
in abstract
the abstract
search abstract
+L+ other
for abstract
explanations, abstract
case-based abstract
explanation abstract
provides abstract
a abstract
practical abstract

for abstract

that abstract
are abstract
both abstract

Existing abstract

contemporary abstract

cannot abstract
be abstract
conveniently abstract
applied abstract
to abstract
specific abstract
learning abstract
problems abstract
(e.g., abstract
training abstract

Moreover, abstract
they abstract

typically abstract
non-generic, abstract
+L+ other
i.e., abstract
they abstract
necessitate abstract
making abstract
assumptions abstract
about abstract
the abstract

The abstract

It abstract

shows abstract

Given abstract

In abstract

this abstract

is abstract
understood abstract
with abstract
an abstract
implicit abstract
"in abstract

the abstract

n abstract

This abstract

this abstract

it abstract

The abstract

We abstract

for abstract
visual abstract

which abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract

as abstract
a abstract

This abstract

both abstract

an abstract

themselves. abstract
The abstract
overall abstract
approach, abstract
called abstract
complex abstract
+L+ other
feature abstract
recognition abstract
or abstract
CFR, abstract
is abstract
unique abstract
for abstract
several abstract
reasons: abstract
it abstract
is abstract
broadly abstract
+L+ other
applicable abstract
to abstract
a abstract
wide abstract
range abstract
of abstract
object abstract
types, abstract
it abstract
makes abstract
constructing abstract

is abstract
capable abstract

either abstract

the abstract

an abstract

+L+ other
Instead abstract
of abstract
a abstract

such abstract

an abstract

CFR abstract
uses abstract

set abstract

are abstract

The abstract

a abstract
single abstract

much abstract
more abstract

This abstract

Abstract abstract
We abstract
introduce abstract

new abstract
kind abstract

language abstract
model, abstract
which abstract
models abstract
whole abstract

directly abstract
using abstract
the abstract
Maximum abstract
Entropy abstract
+L+ other
paradigm. abstract
The abstract
new abstract
model abstract
is abstract
conceptually abstract
simpler, abstract
and abstract
more abstract
naturally abstract
+L+ other
suited abstract
to abstract
modeling abstract
whole-sentence abstract
phenomena, abstract
than abstract
the abstract
conditional abstract
ME abstract
+L+ other
models abstract
proposed abstract
to abstract

By abstract
avoiding abstract
the abstract
chain abstract
rule, abstract
the abstract
model abstract
treats abstract
+L+ other
each abstract
sentence abstract
or abstract
utterance abstract
as abstract
a abstract
"bag abstract
of abstract
features", abstract
where abstract
features abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
arbitrary abstract
computable abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
sentence. abstract
The abstract
model abstract
is abstract
unnor-malizable, abstract
but abstract
this abstract
does abstract
not abstract
interfere abstract
with abstract
training abstract
(done abstract
via abstract
sampling) abstract
+L+ other
or abstract
with abstract
use. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
model abstract
is abstract
computationally abstract
straightforward. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other

cost abstract
of abstract

the abstract
model abstract
is abstract
in abstract
generating abstract

+L+ other

Gibbs abstract
distribution. abstract
Interestingly, abstract
this abstract
cost abstract
has abstract
different abstract
dependencies, abstract
and abstract
is abstract
potentially abstract
lower, abstract

a abstract
comprehensive abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
model-based abstract
diagnosis abstract
which abstract
includes abstract
proposals abstract
for abstract
characterizing abstract
and abstract
computing abstract
preferred abstract
diagnoses, abstract
assuming abstract
that abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
description abstract
is abstract
augmented abstract
with abstract
a abstract
system abstract
structure abstract
(a abstract
directed abstract
graph abstract
explicating abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
interconnections abstract
between abstract
system abstract
components). abstract
Specifically, abstract
we abstract
first abstract
introduce abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
consequence, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
a abstract
syntactically abstract
unconstrained abstract
propositional abstract
sentence abstract
that abstract
characterizes abstract
all abstract
consistency-based abstract
diagnoses abstract
and abstract
show abstract
that abstract
standard abstract
characterizations abstract
of abstract
diagnoses, abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
minimal abstract
conflicts, abstract
correspond abstract
to abstract
syntactic abstract
variations abstract
on abstract
a abstract
consequence. abstract
Second, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
syntactic abstract
variation abstract
on abstract
the abstract
consequence abstract
known abstract
as abstract
negation abstract
normal abstract
form abstract
+L+ other
(NNF) abstract
and abstract
discuss abstract
its abstract
merits abstract
compared abstract
to abstract
standard abstract
variations. abstract
Third, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
basic abstract
+L+ other
algorithm abstract
for abstract
computing abstract
consequences abstract
in abstract
NNF abstract
given abstract
a abstract
structured abstract
system abstract
description. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
show abstract
that abstract
if abstract
the abstract
system abstract
structure abstract
does abstract
not abstract
contain abstract
cycles, abstract
then abstract
there abstract
is abstract
always abstract
a abstract
linear-size abstract
+L+ other
consequence abstract
in abstract
NNF abstract
which abstract
can abstract
be abstract
computed abstract
in abstract
linear abstract
time. abstract
For abstract
arbitrary abstract
system abstract
structures, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
a abstract
precise abstract
connection abstract
between abstract
the abstract
complexity abstract
of abstract
computing abstract
consequences abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
the abstract
topology abstract
of abstract
the abstract
underlying abstract
system abstract
structure. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
an abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
enumerates abstract
the abstract
preferred abstract
diagnoses abstract
characterized abstract
by abstract
a abstract
consequence. abstract
The abstract
algorithm abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
shown abstract
to abstract
take abstract
linear abstract
time abstract
in abstract
the abstract
size abstract
of abstract
the abstract
consequence abstract
if abstract
the abstract
preference abstract

satisfies abstract
+L+ other
some abstract
general abstract
conditions. abstract

The abstract
complexity abstract

and abstract
parallel abstract
processor abstract
scheduling abstract
policies abstract
makes abstract
both abstract
exact abstract
analysis abstract
and abstract
simulation abstract
difficult, abstract
if abstract
not abstract
intractable, abstract
for abstract
large abstract
systems. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
approach abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
performance abstract
modeling abstract
of abstract
multiprogrammed abstract
processor abstract
scheduling abstract
policies, abstract
that abstract
of abstract
interpolation abstract
approximations. abstract
We abstract
first abstract
define abstract
a abstract
workload abstract
model abstract
that abstract
contains abstract
parameters abstract
for abstract
the abstract
essential abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
parallel abstract
+L+ other
applications abstract
with abstract
respect abstract
to abstract

discipline abstract
performance, abstract
yet abstract
lends abstract
itself abstract
to abstract
mathematical abstract
analysis. abstract
Key abstract
+L+ other
features abstract
of abstract
the abstract

model abstract
include abstract
general abstract

general abstract

+L+ other
of abstract

parallelism, abstract
and abstract
a abstract
simple abstract

We abstract
then abstract
show abstract
that abstract
one abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
find abstract
specific abstract
values abstract
of abstract
the abstract
system abstract
parameters abstract
for abstract
which abstract
the abstract
parallel abstract

given abstract
scheduling abstract
+L+ other
policy abstract
reduces abstract
to abstract
a abstract
queueing abstract
system abstract
with abstract
a abstract

Finally, abstract
interpolation abstract
between abstract
+L+ other
the abstract

with abstract

is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
arrive abstract
at abstract
mean abstract

that abstract
hold abstract
over abstract
the abstract
entire abstract
+L+ other

The abstract
interpolation abstract

behavior abstract
and abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
easy abstract
to abstract
evaluate abstract
for abstract

+L+ other
We abstract
illustrate abstract
the abstract
approach abstract
by abstract
developing abstract
and abstract
validating abstract
models abstract
of abstract
three abstract

under abstract

We abstract
discuss abstract
several abstract
insights abstract
and abstract
results abstract
obtained abstract
from abstract
the abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
the abstract
three abstract

under abstract
the abstract
assumed abstract
+L+ other

One abstract

clarifies abstract

This abstract

describes abstract
how abstract

generate abstract
a abstract

which, abstract
when abstract

the abstract

The abstract

The abstract

improves abstract

in abstract
several abstract
ways: abstract
it abstract

is abstract
symmetric abstract

hence abstract
free abstract

it abstract

+L+ other
based abstract
on abstract

The abstract

In abstract

We abstract
study abstract

the abstract

In abstract

we abstract

Next, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
two abstract

solving abstract
double-dummy abstract
bridge abstract
+L+ other
(i.e., abstract
a abstract

The abstract
first abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
combination abstract
of abstract

The abstract
second abstract
forms abstract
a abstract

Next, abstract

we abstract
present abstract
a abstract

ABSTRACT abstract
+L+ other
Speech abstract
disfluencies abstract
(such abstract
as abstract
filled abstract
pauses, abstract
repetitions, abstract
restarts) abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
among abstract
the abstract
characteristics abstract
distinguishing abstract
spontaneous abstract
speech abstract
from abstract
+L+ other
planned abstract
or abstract
read abstract
speech. abstract
We abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
language abstract
model abstract
that abstract
predicts abstract
disfluencies abstract
probabilistically abstract
and abstract
uses abstract
an abstract
edited, abstract
fluent abstract
context abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
predict abstract
following abstract
words. abstract
The abstract
model abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract
generalization abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
the abstract
standard abstract
N-gram abstract
language abstract
model. abstract
It abstract
uses abstract
dynamic abstract
programming abstract
to abstract
compute abstract
the abstract
probability abstract
of abstract
a abstract
word abstract
sequence, abstract
taking abstract
into abstract
+L+ other
account abstract
possible abstract
hidden abstract
disfluency abstract
events. abstract
We abstract
analyze abstract
the abstract
model's abstract
performance abstract
for abstract
various abstract
disfluency abstract
types abstract
on abstract
the abstract
Switchboard abstract
+L+ other
corpus. abstract
We abstract
find abstract
that abstract
the abstract
model abstract
reduces abstract
word abstract
perplexity abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
neighborhood abstract
of abstract
disfluency abstract
events; abstract
however, abstract
overall abstract
differences abstract
+L+ other
are abstract
small abstract
and abstract
have abstract
no abstract
significant abstract
impact abstract
on abstract
recognition abstract
accuracy. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
also abstract
note abstract
that abstract
for abstract
modeling abstract
of abstract
the abstract
most abstract
frequent abstract
type abstract

dis-fluency, abstract
filled abstract
pauses, abstract
a abstract
segmentation abstract
of abstract

The abstract

In abstract

an abstract

We abstract

get abstract
a abstract
very abstract

Speedup abstract
is abstract
achieved abstract
by abstract
adapting abstract
the abstract

the abstract

In abstract
addition, abstract
we abstract
provide abstract
mechanisms abstract
to abstract
detect abstract
and abstract
properly abstract
handle abstract
bifurcation abstract
points, abstract
+L+ other
where abstract
the abstract
curve abstract
intersects abstract
itself. abstract
Finally, abstract
the abstract
algorithm abstract
allows abstract
the abstract
user abstract
to abstract
trade-off abstract
+L+ other
accuracy abstract
for abstract
speed abstract
and abstract
vice abstract
a abstract

We abstract
conclude abstract
by abstract

For abstract

the abstract

This abstract
can abstract
sometimes abstract

We abstract
describe abstract

framework, abstract
based abstract

regeneration, abstract
which abstract
allows abstract

ABSTRACT abstract
Stepwise abstract
refinement abstract

programs abstract
has abstract
proven abstract
to abstract
be abstract
a abstract
suitable abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
for abstract
developing abstract
parallel abstract
and abstract
distributed abstract
programs. abstract
We abstract
examine abstract
and abstract
compare abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
number abstract
of abstract
different abstract
notions abstract
of abstract
program abstract
refinement abstract
for abstract
Unity. abstract
Two abstract
of abstract
these abstract
notions abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
based abstract
on abstract
execution abstract
sequences. abstract
Refinement abstract
corresponds abstract
to abstract
the abstract
reduction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
set abstract
of abstract
execution abstract
sequences, abstract
i.e. abstract
reducing abstract
the abstract
amount abstract
of abstract
nondeterminism. abstract
The abstract
other abstract
refinement abstract
+L+ other
notions abstract
are abstract
based abstract
on abstract
Unity abstract
properties abstract
as abstract
introduced abstract
by abstract
Chandy abstract
and abstract
Misra. abstract
The abstract
Unity abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
to abstract
refine abstract
specifications. abstract
Although abstract
it abstract
has abstract
proven abstract
a abstract
suitable abstract
formalism abstract
for abstract
deriving abstract
+L+ other
algorithms, abstract
it abstract
seems abstract
less abstract
suitable abstract
for abstract
handling abstract
implementation abstract
details. abstract
Following abstract
Sanders abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
Singh, abstract
we abstract
formalize abstract
program abstract
refinement abstract
in abstract
the abstract
Unity abstract
framework abstract
as abstract
the abstract
preservation abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
Unity abstract
properties. abstract
We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
Unity abstract
properties abstract
are abstract
not abstract
powerful abstract
enough abstract
to abstract
characterize abstract
execution abstract
sequences. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
consequence, abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
property-preserving abstract
refinement abstract
+L+ other
differs abstract
from abstract
the abstract
notion abstract
of abstract
reducing abstract
the abstract

of abstract

There abstract
is abstract
an abstract
emerging abstract
consensus abstract
that abstract
an abstract
explicit abstract
architectural abstract
model abstract
+L+ other
would abstract
be abstract
invaluable abstract
for abstract
large abstract
evolving abstract

providing abstract

with abstract
a abstract

which abstract
such abstract
a abstract

But abstract
the abstract
great abstract
promise abstract
of abstract
architectural abstract

has abstract
not abstract
been abstract
+L+ other
fulfilled abstract
so abstract
far, abstract
due abstract
to abstract
a abstract
gap abstract
between abstract

the abstract

it abstract
purports abstract

It abstract
is abstract
our abstract
contention abstract
that abstract
this abstract
gap abstract

bridged abstract
if abstract
the abstract

We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
this abstract

has abstract
two abstract
major abstract
beneficial abstract
consequences: abstract
First, abstract
by abstract
bridging abstract
the abstract
above abstract
mentioned abstract
gap abstract
+L+ other
between abstract
an abstract
architectural abstract
model abstract
and abstract
the abstract
actual abstract
system, abstract
an abstract
enforced abstract
architectural abstract

provides abstract
a abstract
truly abstract
reliable abstract
framework abstract
within abstract
which abstract
a abstract
system abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
reasoned abstract
about abstract
and abstract
maintained. abstract
Second, abstract
our abstract
model abstract
provides abstract
software abstract
developers abstract
with abstract
a abstract
carefully abstract
circumscribed abstract
flexibility abstract
in abstract
molding abstract
the abstract

law abstract

By abstract

ABSTRACT abstract

The abstract
problem abstract

involves abstract
correctly abstract
+L+ other
classifying abstract

+L+ other
a abstract
category abstract
that abstract
identifies abstract
the abstract
+L+ other

+L+ other
The abstract
problem abstract
is abstract
difficult abstract
because abstract
+L+ other

not abstract

+L+ other
because abstract
successive abstract

that abstract

Then, abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
presents abstract
methods abstract
that abstract
make abstract
it abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
efficiently abstract
support abstract
irregular abstract
problems abstract
using abstract
data abstract
+L+ other
parallel abstract
languages. abstract
The abstract
approach abstract
involves abstract
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
a abstract
portable, abstract
compiler-independent, abstract
runtime abstract
support abstract
+L+ other
library abstract
called abstract
CHAOS. abstract
The abstract

The abstract
CHAOS abstract

are abstract
used abstract
by abstract
a abstract

Fortran abstract

compiler abstract
as abstract
runtime abstract
support abstract
for abstract
irregular abstract

This abstract

compiler-generated abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
hand-parallelized abstract
versions abstract
of abstract

The abstract
first abstract

is abstract

A abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
While abstract
the abstract
task abstract
of abstract
answering abstract
queries abstract
from abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
arbitrary abstract
propositional abstract
theory abstract
is abstract
intractable abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
general, abstract
it abstract

efficiently abstract
+L+ other
if abstract
the abstract

This abstract
suggests abstract
that abstract
it abstract
+L+ other
may abstract
be abstract
more abstract
efficient abstract

answer abstract
queries abstract
using abstract
a abstract
"Horn abstract
approximation"; abstract
i.e., abstract
a abstract
horn abstract
theory abstract
that abstract
is abstract
semantically abstract
similar abstract
to abstract
the abstract
original abstract
+L+ other
theory. abstract
The abstract
utility abstract

any abstract
such abstract

+L+ other
depends abstract
on abstract
how abstract
often abstract
it abstract
produces abstract
answers abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
the abstract

system abstract

+L+ other
we abstract
therefore abstract
seek abstract
an abstract
approximation abstract
whose abstract
expected abstract

is abstract
maximal. abstract
Unfortunately, abstract
+L+ other
there abstract
are abstract
several abstract
obstacles abstract
to abstract
achieving abstract
this abstract
goal abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
practice: abstract
(i) abstract
The abstract
optimal abstract
approximation abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
the abstract
query abstract
distribution, abstract
which abstract
is abstract
typically abstract
not abstract
known abstract
a abstract

(ii) abstract
identifying abstract
the abstract
optimal abstract
approximation abstract
is abstract
intractable, abstract
even abstract
given abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
query abstract
distribution; abstract
and abstract
(iii) abstract
the abstract
optimal abstract
approximation abstract
might abstract
be abstract
too abstract
large abstract
to abstract
guarantee abstract
+L+ other
tractable abstract
inference. abstract
This abstract
paper abstract
presents abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
that abstract
overcomes abstract
(or abstract
side-steps) abstract
each abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
these abstract
obstacles. abstract
We abstract
define abstract
a abstract

process, abstract

that abstract

Advantages abstract

our abstract

include abstract
(1) abstract

We abstract
circumvent abstract
this abstract
restriction abstract

applying abstract

partial abstract

+L+ other
and abstract
a abstract
certain abstract
amount abstract

We abstract
construct abstract

a abstract

Much abstract

In abstract

we abstract
formulate abstract
a abstract

We abstract
present abstract

The abstract

basically abstract
a abstract
matching abstract

In abstract

we abstract

a abstract

where abstract

a abstract

The abstract

consists abstract
of abstract
two abstract

Inversion abstract
of abstract
multilayer abstract

networks abstract
is abstract
a abstract
method abstract
which abstract
tries abstract
to abstract
answer abstract
questions abstract
+L+ other
like abstract
"What abstract
kind abstract
of abstract
input abstract
will abstract
give abstract
a abstract
desired abstract
output?" abstract
or abstract
"Is abstract
it abstract
possible abstract
to abstract
get abstract
a abstract
desired abstract
+L+ other
output abstract
(under abstract
special abstract
input/output abstract
constraints)?". abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
will abstract
describe abstract
two abstract
methods abstract
of abstract
inverting abstract
a abstract
connectionist abstract
network. abstract
Firstly, abstract
we abstract
extend abstract
+L+ other
inversion abstract
via abstract
backpropagation abstract
(Linden/Kindermann abstract
[4], abstract
Williams abstract
[11]) abstract
to abstract
recurrent abstract
(El-man abstract
[1], abstract
Jordan abstract

Mozer abstract
[5], abstract
Williams/Zipser abstract
[10]), abstract
time-delayed abstract
(Waibel abstract
at abstract
al. abstract
[9]) abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
discrete abstract
versions abstract
of abstract
continuous abstract
networks abstract
(Pineda abstract
[7], abstract
Pearlmutter abstract
[6]). abstract
The abstract
result abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
inversion abstract
is abstract
an abstract
input abstract
vector. abstract
The abstract
corresponding abstract
output abstract
vector abstract
is abstract
equal abstract
to abstract
the abstract
target abstract
+L+ other
vector abstract
except abstract
a abstract
small abstract
remainder. abstract
The abstract
knowledge abstract
of abstract
those abstract
attractors abstract
may abstract
help abstract
to abstract
understand abstract
the abstract
function abstract
and abstract
the abstract
generalization abstract
qualities abstract
of abstract
connectionist abstract
systems abstract
of abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
kind. abstract
+L+ other
Secondly, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract
new abstract
inversion abstract
method abstract
for abstract
proving abstract
the abstract
non-existence abstract
of abstract
an abstract
+L+ other
input abstract
combination abstract
under abstract
special abstract
constraints, abstract
e.g. abstract
in abstract
a abstract
subspace abstract
of abstract
the abstract
input abstract
space. abstract
This abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
works abstract
by abstract
iterative abstract
exclusion abstract
of abstract
invalid abstract
activation abstract

It abstract
might abstract
be abstract
a abstract
helpful abstract
+L+ other
way abstract
to abstract
judge abstract
the abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
a abstract
trained abstract
network. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
conclude abstract
with abstract
simulation abstract
results abstract
of abstract
three abstract
different abstract
tasks: abstract
XOR, abstract
morse abstract
signal abstract
decoding abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
handwritten abstract
digit abstract
recognition. abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
paradigm, abstract
namely, abstract
Ratio abstract
Rules, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
are abstract
quantifiable abstract
in abstract
that abstract
we abstract
can abstract
measure abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
"goodness" abstract
of abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
discovered abstract
rules. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
to abstract
use abstract
the abstract
"guessing abstract
error" abstract
as abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
measure abstract
of abstract
the abstract
"goodness", abstract
that abstract
is, abstract
the abstract
root-mean-square abstract
error abstract
of abstract
the abstract
reconstructed abstract
values abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
the abstract
cells abstract
of abstract
the abstract
given abstract
matrix, abstract
when abstract
we abstract
pretend abstract
that abstract
they abstract
are abstract
unknown. abstract
Another abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
a abstract
novel abstract
method abstract
to abstract
guess abstract
missing/hidden abstract
values abstract
from abstract
the abstract
Ratio abstract
Rules abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
our abstract
method abstract
derives. abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
if abstract
somebody abstract
bought abstract
$10 abstract
of abstract
milk abstract
and abstract
$3 abstract
of abstract
bread, abstract
our abstract
+L+ other
rules abstract
can abstract
"guess" abstract
the abstract
amount abstract
spent abstract
on, abstract
say, abstract
+L+ other
butter. abstract
Thus, abstract
we abstract
can abstract
perform abstract
a abstract
variety abstract
of abstract
important abstract
tasks abstract
such abstract
as abstract
forecasting, abstract
answering abstract
+L+ other
"what-if" abstract
scenarios, abstract
detecting abstract
outliers, abstract
and abstract
visualizing abstract
the abstract

Moreover, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
how abstract

Recovery abstract

A abstract

We abstract

These abstract

In abstract

how abstract
the abstract

Taking abstract

The abstract
problem abstract
of abstract
belief abstract
changehow abstract
an abstract
agent abstract
should abstract
revise abstract
her abstract
beliefs abstract
upon abstract
learning abstract
new abstract
+L+ other
informationhas abstract
been abstract
an abstract
active abstract
area abstract
of abstract
research abstract
in abstract
both abstract
philosophy abstract
and abstract
artificial abstract
intelligence. abstract
+L+ other
Many abstract
approaches abstract
to abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
have abstract
been abstract
proposed abstract
in abstract
the abstract
literature. abstract
Our abstract
goal abstract
is abstract
not abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
introduce abstract
yet abstract
another abstract
approach, abstract
but abstract
to abstract
examine abstract
carefully abstract
the abstract
rationale abstract
underlying abstract
the abstract
approaches abstract
+L+ other
already abstract
taken abstract
in abstract
the abstract
literature, abstract
and abstract
to abstract
highlight abstract
what abstract
we abstract
view abstract
as abstract
methodological abstract
problems abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
literature. abstract
The abstract
main abstract
message abstract
is abstract
that abstract
to abstract
study abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
carefully, abstract
we abstract
must abstract
be abstract
quite abstract
explicit abstract
+L+ other
about abstract
the abstract
ontology abstract
or abstract
scenario abstract
underlying abstract
the abstract
belief abstract
change abstract
process. abstract
This abstract
is abstract
something abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
has abstract
been abstract
missing abstract
in abstract
previous abstract
work, abstract
with abstract
its abstract
focus abstract
on abstract
postulates. abstract
Our abstract
analysis abstract
shows abstract
that abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
must abstract
pay abstract
particular abstract
attention abstract
to abstract
two abstract
issues abstract
which abstract
have abstract
often abstract
been abstract
taken abstract
for abstract
granted: abstract
The abstract
first abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
how abstract
we abstract
model abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
epistemic abstract
state. abstract
(Do abstract
we abstract
use abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
beliefs, abstract
or abstract
a abstract
richer abstract
structure, abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
an abstract
ordering abstract
on abstract
worlds? abstract
And abstract
if abstract
we abstract
use abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
beliefs, abstract
in abstract
what abstract
language abstract
are abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
beliefs abstract
are abstract
expressed?) abstract
The abstract
second abstract
is abstract
the abstract
status abstract
of abstract
observations. abstract
(Are abstract
observations abstract
known abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
true, abstract
or abstract
just abstract
believed? abstract
In abstract
the abstract
latter abstract
case, abstract
how abstract
firm abstract
is abstract
the abstract
belief?) abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
we abstract
argue abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
even abstract
postulates abstract
that abstract
have abstract
been abstract
called abstract
beyond abstract
controversy abstract
are abstract
unreasonable abstract
when abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
+L+ other
beliefs abstract
include abstract
beliefs abstract
about abstract
her abstract
own abstract
epistemic abstract
state abstract
as abstract
well abstract
as abstract
the abstract
external abstract
world. abstract
Issues abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
status abstract
of abstract
observations abstract
arise abstract
particularly abstract
when abstract
we abstract
consider abstract
iterated abstract
belief abstract
revision, abstract
and abstract
we abstract
must abstract
+L+ other
confront abstract
the abstract
possibility abstract
of abstract
revising abstract

Furthermore, abstract
the abstract

uses abstract

Our abstract

is abstract
organized abstract

three abstract
major abstract
phases: abstract
analyzing abstract
array abstract
references, abstract
allocating abstract
the abstract
computation abstract
and abstract
data abstract
to abstract
the abstract

to abstract
optimize abstract

and abstract

+L+ other
An abstract
optimizing abstract
compiler abstract
for abstract
scalable abstract
parallel abstract
machines abstract
requires abstract
more abstract
sophisticated abstract
program abstract
analysis abstract
than abstract
the abstract
traditional abstract
data abstract

Our abstract
compiler abstract
uses abstract
a abstract

identify abstract

In abstract
order abstract
to abstract
allocate abstract
the abstract
computation abstract

data abstract
to abstract
the abstract
processors, abstract
the abstract
compiler abstract
+L+ other
first abstract
transforms abstract
the abstract
program abstract
to abstract
expose abstract
loop-level abstract
parallelism abstract
in abstract
the abstract
computation. abstract
It abstract
then abstract
finds abstract
a abstract
decomposition abstract

+L+ other
such abstract
that abstract
parallelism abstract
is abstract
exploited abstract
and abstract
the abstract
communication abstract
overhead abstract
is abstract

The abstract
compiler abstract
will abstract
trade abstract
off abstract
extra abstract
degrees abstract
of abstract
parallelism abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
reduce abstract
or abstract
eliminate abstract
communication. abstract
Finally, abstract
the abstract
compiler abstract
generates abstract
code abstract
+L+ other

The abstract

GMMS abstract

an abstract

Memory abstract

an abstract
important abstract

that abstract

Several abstract

this abstract

However, abstract
the abstract

To abstract

we abstract

a abstract

We abstract

how abstract

The abstract
distribution abstract
of abstract

among abstract

and abstract
+L+ other

is abstract
a abstract
crucial abstract
question abstract
faced abstract
by abstract
designers abstract
of abstract
large-scale abstract
+L+ other

If abstract

is abstract

How abstract
much abstract

And abstract
how abstract
do abstract
these abstract

larger abstract

+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
explore abstract
the abstract
above abstract
questions abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
characteristics abstract
of abstract
five abstract
important abstract
classes abstract
of abstract
large-scale abstract
parallel abstract
scientific abstract
applications. abstract
We abstract
first abstract
show abstract
that abstract
all abstract
the abstract
applications abstract
have abstract
a abstract
hierarchy abstract
of abstract
well-defined abstract
per-processor abstract
working abstract
+L+ other
sets, abstract
whose abstract
size, abstract

impact abstract
and abstract

+L+ other
can abstract
help abstract
determine abstract
how abstract
large abstract
different abstract
levels abstract
of abstract
a abstract
multiprocessor's abstract
cache abstract
hierarchy abstract
should abstract
be. abstract
Then, abstract
we abstract
use abstract
these abstract
working abstract
sets abstract
together abstract
with abstract
certain abstract
other abstract
important abstract
characteristics abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
applications|such abstract
as abstract

+L+ other
concurrency, abstract
and abstract

reflect abstract
upon abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
broader abstract
question abstract
of abstract
the abstract
granularity abstract
of abstract
processing abstract
nodes abstract
in abstract
high-performance abstract
multiprocessors. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
find abstract
that abstract
very abstract
small abstract
caches abstract
whose abstract
sizes abstract
do abstract
not abstract
increase abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
the abstract
problem abstract
or abstract
machine abstract
size abstract
are abstract
adequate abstract
for abstract
all abstract
but abstract
two abstract
of abstract
+L+ other

application abstract
classes. abstract
Even abstract
in abstract
the abstract
two abstract
exceptions, abstract
the abstract

scale abstract
quite abstract
slowly abstract

problems abstract
that abstract
will abstract
be abstract
run abstract
in abstract
the abstract
foreseeable abstract
future abstract
+L+ other

small. abstract
We abstract
also abstract
find abstract
that abstract
relatively abstract
fine-grained abstract
machines, abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
large abstract
numbers abstract
of abstract

and abstract
quite abstract

For abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
evaluate abstract
storage abstract
system abstract
alternatives abstract
for abstract
movies-on-demand abstract
video abstract

We abstract
begin abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
characterizing abstract
the abstract
movies-on-demand abstract
workload. abstract
Then abstract
we abstract
study abstract
disk abstract
farms abstract
in abstract
which abstract
one abstract
movie abstract
is abstract
stored abstract
per abstract
+L+ other
disk. abstract
This abstract
is abstract
a abstract
simple abstract
scheme, abstract
but abstract
it abstract
wastes abstract
substantial abstract
disk abstract
bandwidth, abstract
since abstract
disks abstract
holding abstract
less abstract
popular abstract
+L+ other
movies abstract
are abstract
under-utilized; abstract
also, abstract
good abstract
performance abstract
requires abstract
that abstract
movies abstract
be abstract
replicated abstract
to abstract
reflect abstract
the abstract
user abstract
+L+ other
request abstract
pattern. abstract
Next, abstract
we abstract
examine abstract
disk abstract
farms abstract
in abstract
which abstract
movies abstract
are abstract
striped abstract
across abstract
disks, abstract
and abstract
find abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
striped abstract
video abstract
servers abstract
offer abstract
close abstract
to abstract
full abstract
utilization abstract
of abstract
the abstract
disks abstract
by abstract
achieving abstract
better abstract
load abstract
balancing. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
storage abstract
hierarchies abstract
for abstract
video abstract
service abstract
that abstract
include abstract
a abstract
tertiary abstract
library abstract
along abstract
with abstract
a abstract
disk abstract
farm. abstract

Unfortunately, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
that abstract
the abstract
performance abstract

neither abstract
magnetic abstract
tape abstract

optical abstract

+L+ other
as abstract
part abstract
of abstract
a abstract

is abstract
adequate abstract

predicted abstract

We abstract
suggest abstract
+L+ other
changes abstract
to abstract
tertiary abstract
libraries abstract
that abstract
would abstract
make abstract
them abstract
better-suited abstract
to abstract

The abstract

We abstract

Our abstract
main abstract
result abstract
is abstract
a abstract
proof abstract
that abstract
such abstract
algorithms abstract

are abstract
boosting abstract

By abstract
this abstract
we abstract
mean abstract
that abstract
if abstract
the abstract

that abstract
label abstract
the abstract

nodes abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other

weakly abstract
approximate abstract

then abstract
the abstract

+L+ other
study abstract
will abstract
amplify abstract
this abstract
weak abstract
advantage abstract
to abstract
build abstract
a abstract
tree abstract
achieving abstract
any abstract
desired abstract
level abstract

accuracy. abstract
The abstract
bounds abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
obtain abstract
for abstract
this abstract
amplification abstract
show abstract
an abstract
interesting abstract
dependence abstract
on abstract
the abstract
splitting abstract
criterion abstract
used abstract
by abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
top-down abstract
algorithm. abstract
More abstract
precisely, abstract
if abstract
the abstract
functions abstract
used abstract
to abstract
label abstract
the abstract
internal abstract
nodes abstract
have abstract
error abstract
1=2 abstract
+L+ other
as abstract
approximations abstract

the abstract

Thus abstract
(for abstract

a abstract

For abstract
a abstract

the abstract

is abstract
obtained, abstract
which abstract

provably abstract
optimal abstract
for abstract
decision abstract

Two abstract
sets abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
assumptions abstract
have abstract
to abstract
be abstract
made: abstract
(1) abstract
What abstract
is abstract
a abstract
trade? abstract
We abstract
define abstract
a abstract
trade abstract
to abstract
begin abstract
when abstract
an abstract
account abstract
opens abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
position, abstract
and abstract
to abstract
end abstract
when abstract
its abstract
position abstract
size abstract
returns abstract
to abstract
zero. abstract
We abstract
describe abstract
each abstract
trade abstract
by abstract
several abstract
trade-specific abstract
variables abstract
(e.g., abstract
length abstract
of abstract
trade, abstract
maximum abstract
position abstract
size, abstract
opening abstract
move, abstract
long abstract
or abstract
short) abstract
and abstract
several abstract
+L+ other
exogenous, abstract
market-specific abstract
variables abstract
(e.g., abstract
price, abstract
volatility, abstract
trading abstract
volume). abstract
(2) abstract
What abstract
process abstract
generated abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
data? abstract
We abstract
assume abstract
a abstract

of abstract
Gaussians. abstract
An abstract
observed abstract
trade abstract
is abstract
interpreted abstract
as abstract
a abstract
noisy abstract
realization abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
one abstract
of abstract
the abstract
mixture abstract
components. abstract
This abstract
paper abstract
assumes abstract
identity abstract
covariance abstract
matrices. abstract
Furthermore, abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
trade abstract
is abstract
fully abstract
assigned abstract
to abstract
a abstract
single abstract
cluster. abstract
We abstract
compare abstract
this abstract
approach abstract

we abstract

them abstract

The abstract
paper abstract
makes abstract
two abstract
contributions abstract
to abstract
work abstract
in abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
area: abstract
+L+ other
* abstract
The abstract
first abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
experiments abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
explore abstract
the abstract
trade-offs abstract
between abstract
techniques abstract
previously abstract
defined abstract
by abstract
Lars abstract
Andersen abstract
and abstract
Bjarne abstract
Steens-gaard. abstract
The abstract
former abstract
has abstract
a abstract
cubic abstract
worst-case abstract
running abstract
+L+ other
time, abstract
while abstract
the abstract
latter abstract
is abstract
essentially abstract
linear. abstract
However, abstract
the abstract
former abstract
may abstract
be abstract
much abstract
more abstract
precise abstract
than abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
latter. abstract
We abstract
have abstract
found abstract
that abstract
in abstract
practice, abstract
Ander-sen's abstract
algorithm abstract
is abstract
consistently abstract
more abstract
precise abstract
than abstract
+L+ other
Steensgaard's. abstract
For abstract
small abstract
programs, abstract
there abstract
is abstract
very abstract
+L+ other
little abstract
difference abstract
in abstract
the abstract
times abstract
required abstract
by abstract
the abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
approaches; abstract
however, abstract
for abstract
larger abstract
programs, abstract
Ander-sen's abstract
algorithm abstract
can abstract
be abstract
much abstract
slower abstract
than abstract
Steens abstract
+L+ other
gaard's. abstract
+L+ other
* abstract
The abstract
second abstract
contribution abstract
is abstract
the abstract
definition abstract
of abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
new abstract
algorithms. abstract
The abstract
first abstract

can abstract

The abstract
second abstract

uses abstract
the abstract

Its abstract

+L+ other

The abstract

Our abstract

the abstract

Basically, abstract
there abstract

We abstract

if abstract

(i.e., abstract
TMM, abstract
TimeGraph abstract
and abstract
TimeGraph-II) abstract
seem abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
best abstract
option. abstract
While abstract
they abstract

the abstract

the abstract

Of abstract

these abstract

the abstract

Of abstract

Abstract. abstract
The abstract
simple abstract
Bayesian abstract
classifier abstract
is abstract
known abstract
to abstract
be abstract
optimal abstract
when abstract
attributes abstract
are abstract
independent abstract
+L+ other
given abstract
the abstract
class, abstract
but abstract
the abstract
question abstract
of abstract
whether abstract
other abstract
sufficient abstract
conditions abstract
for abstract
its abstract
optimality abstract
exist abstract
has abstract
+L+ other
so abstract
far abstract
not abstract
been abstract
explored. abstract
Empirical abstract
results abstract
showing abstract
that abstract
it abstract
performs abstract
surprisingly abstract
well abstract
in abstract
many abstract
+L+ other
domains abstract
containing abstract
clear abstract
attribute abstract
dependences abstract
suggest abstract
that abstract
the abstract
answer abstract
to abstract
this abstract
question abstract
may abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
positive. abstract
This abstract
article abstract
shows abstract
that, abstract
although abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
classifier's abstract
probability abstract
estimates abstract
are abstract
only abstract
+L+ other
optimal abstract
under abstract
quadratic abstract
loss abstract
if abstract
the abstract
independence abstract
assumption abstract
holds, abstract
the abstract
classifier abstract
itself abstract
can abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
optimal abstract
under abstract
zero-one abstract
loss abstract
(misclassification abstract
rate) abstract
even abstract
when abstract
this abstract
assumption abstract
is abstract
violated abstract
by abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
wide abstract
margin. abstract
The abstract
region abstract
of abstract
quadratic-loss abstract
optimality abstract
of abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
classifier abstract
is abstract
in abstract
fact abstract
a abstract
second-order abstract
infinitesimal abstract
fraction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
region abstract
of abstract
zero-one abstract
optimality. abstract
This abstract
implies abstract
that abstract
the abstract
Bayesian abstract
+L+ other
classifier abstract
has abstract
a abstract
much abstract
greater abstract
range abstract
of abstract
applicability abstract
than abstract
previously abstract
thought. abstract
For abstract
example, abstract
in abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
article abstract
it abstract
is abstract
shown abstract
to abstract
be abstract
optimal abstract
for abstract
learning abstract
conjunctions abstract
and abstract
disjunctions, abstract
even abstract
though abstract
they abstract
+L+ other
violate abstract
the abstract
independence abstract
assumption. abstract
Further, abstract
studies abstract
in abstract
artificial abstract
domains abstract
show abstract
that abstract
it abstract
will abstract
often abstract
+L+ other
outperform abstract
more abstract
powerful abstract
classifiers abstract
for abstract
common abstract
training abstract
set abstract
sizes abstract
and abstract
numbers abstract
of abstract
attributes, abstract
even abstract
+L+ other
if abstract
its abstract
bias abstract
is abstract
a abstract
priori abstract
much abstract
less abstract
appropriate abstract
to abstract
the abstract
domain. abstract
This abstract
article's abstract
results abstract
also abstract
imply abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
detecting abstract

is abstract
not abstract
necessarily abstract
the abstract

this abstract

e.g., abstract
the abstract

that abstract

We abstract
show abstract

this abstract

At abstract

We abstract
show abstract

the abstract

One abstract

Though abstract
they abstract
seem abstract

+L+ other
in abstract
many abstract

the abstract
two abstract

in abstract

Past abstract
approaches abstract

learning abstract
control abstract

have abstract
usually abstract
employed abstract
+L+ other
explanation-based abstract
learning abstract
(EBL) abstract
to abstract
generate abstract

Unfortunately, abstract
EBL abstract
alone abstract
+L+ other
often abstract
produces abstract
overly abstract
complex abstract
rules abstract
that abstract
actually abstract
decrease abstract
rather abstract

overall abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
presents abstract
a abstract
novel abstract
learning abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
control abstract
knowledge abstract
+L+ other
acquisition abstract
that abstract
integrates abstract
explanation-based abstract
learning abstract
with abstract
techniques abstract
from abstract
inductive abstract
+L+ other
logic abstract
programming. abstract
In abstract
our abstract
learning abstract
system abstract
Scope, abstract
EBL abstract
is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
constrain abstract
an abstract
inductive abstract
search abstract
for abstract
control abstract
heuristics abstract
that abstract
help abstract
a abstract
planner abstract
choose abstract

Scope abstract
is abstract
one abstract

the abstract
few abstract
systems abstract

Specifically, abstract
this abstract
proposal abstract
describes abstract
how abstract
Scope abstract
+L+ other
learns abstract
domain-specific abstract
control abstract
rules abstract
for abstract
the abstract
UCPOP abstract
planning abstract
algorithm. abstract
The abstract
resulting abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
is abstract
shown abstract
to abstract
produce abstract
significant abstract
speedup abstract
in abstract
two abstract
different abstract
planning abstract
domains, abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
be abstract
more abstract
effective abstract
than abstract
a abstract
pure abstract
EBL abstract
approach. abstract
Future abstract

will abstract
be abstract
performed abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
three abstract
main abstract
areas. abstract
First, abstract
Scope's abstract

be abstract
extended abstract
to abstract

+L+ other
additional abstract
techniques abstract
such abstract
as abstract
constructive abstract

and abstract

Second, abstract
+L+ other
Scope abstract

more abstract

several abstract

been abstract
+L+ other

more abstract

between abstract
+L+ other
Scope abstract

Third, abstract
Scope abstract

implemented abstract

order abstract

test abstract

Such abstract

We abstract
formalize abstract

The abstract

the abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
describes abstract
several abstract
of abstract
our abstract
experiences abstract
with abstract
a abstract
real-time abstract
scheduler. abstract
Using abstract
a abstract
robot abstract
control abstract
application abstract
program, abstract
we abstract
motivate abstract
the abstract
importance abstract
of abstract
supporting abstract
multiple abstract
schedulers abstract
within abstract
the abstract
same abstract
application abstract
+L+ other
program. abstract
We abstract
demonstrate abstract
the abstract
utility abstract
of abstract
speculative abstract
task abstract
execution abstract
in abstract
dynamic abstract
real-time abstract
systems, abstract
and abstract
describe abstract
the abstract
implementation abstract
of abstract
a abstract
scheduler abstract
for abstract
performing abstract
speculative abstract
execution abstract
and abstract
recovery. abstract
We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
existing abstract
real-time abstract
scheduler abstract
interfaces abstract
have abstract
scope abstract
for abstract
improvement, abstract
especially abstract
when abstract
scheduling abstract
latency abstract
must abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
low abstract
and abstract
when abstract
multiple abstract
schedulers abstract
used abstract
by abstract
a abstract
single abstract
application abstract
must abstract
co-exist abstract
on abstract
a abstract
single abstract
processor. abstract
A abstract
new abstract
+L+ other
scheduler abstract
interface abstract
is abstract
specified abstract
and abstract
its abstract
basic abstract
costs abstract
are abstract
evaluated abstract
experimentally. abstract
Preliminary abstract
measurements abstract
on abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
KSR-1 abstract
machine abstract
are abstract
quoted. abstract
The abstract
measurements abstract
demonstrate abstract
how abstract
the abstract

temporal abstract

+L+ other
may abstract
be abstract
reduced abstract
by abstract
use abstract
of abstract
access abstract
structures abstract
to abstract

structures. abstract
Finally, abstract
there abstract
are abstract
several abstract
overheads abstract
+L+ other
associated abstract
with abstract
speculative abstract
execution, abstract
and abstract
multiple abstract
schedulers abstract
in abstract
a abstract
single abstract

We abstract

the abstract

Such abstract

requires abstract

We abstract

that abstract

We abstract

Unlike abstract
current abstract
models abstract
that abstract
combine abstract
both abstract
primitive abstract
actions abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
macro-actions abstract
and abstract
leave abstract
the abstract

we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
hierarchical abstract
model abstract
(using abstract
+L+ other
an abstract
abstract abstract
MDP) abstract
that abstract
works abstract
with abstract
macro-actions abstract
+L+ other
only, abstract
and abstract
that abstract
significantly abstract
reduces abstract
the abstract
size abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
state abstract

This abstract
is abstract
achieved abstract
by abstract
treating abstract
macro-actions abstract
as abstract
local abstract
policies abstract
that abstract
act abstract
in abstract
certain abstract
regions abstract
+L+ other

by abstract

abstract abstract
MDP abstract

The abstract
abstract abstract
MDP abstract
approximates abstract
the abstract
original abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
solved abstract
more abstract
efficiently. abstract
We abstract
discuss abstract
several abstract
ways abstract
in abstract
which abstract
macro-actions abstract
can abstract
be abstract
generated abstract
to abstract
ensure abstract

Finally, abstract

we abstract
consider abstract

We abstract
are abstract
analyzing abstract
storage abstract

for abstract
two abstract
and abstract
three abstract
dimensional abstract
raster abstract
type abstract
data abstract
which abstract
are abstract
used abstract
+L+ other
for abstract
feature abstract
retrieval. abstract
The abstract
features abstract
are abstract
one, abstract
two abstract
or abstract
three abstract
dimensional abstract
objects abstract
with abstract
regular abstract
outlines abstract
+L+ other
like abstract
a abstract
rectangle abstract
or abstract
a abstract
prism. abstract
The abstract
features abstract
could abstract
be abstract
parts abstract
of abstract
a abstract

or abstract
image, abstract
an abstract
area abstract
of abstract
special abstract
+L+ other
interest abstract
for abstract
searching abstract
after abstract
oil, abstract
a abstract
sequence abstract
of abstract
ultra abstract
sound abstract
images, abstract
and abstract
so abstract
on. abstract
The abstract
storage abstract
medium abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
magnetic abstract
disk. abstract
The abstract
data abstract
are abstract
stored abstract
in abstract
chunks abstract
or abstract
blocks abstract
representing abstract
a abstract
regular abstract
part abstract
of abstract
the abstract
source abstract
+L+ other
object. abstract
We abstract
analyze abstract
the abstract
shape abstract
and abstract
the abstract
size abstract
to abstract
minimize abstract
the abstract
cost abstract
of abstract
retrieval. abstract
The abstract
optimization abstract
is abstract
+L+ other
based abstract
on abstract
minimum abstract
time abstract
to abstract
do abstract
retrieval. abstract
We abstract
have abstract
five abstract
combinations: abstract
Lines abstract
and abstract
areas abstract
from abstract

and abstract
+L+ other
volumes, abstract
and abstract
volumes abstract
from abstract
volumes. abstract
The abstract
optimal abstract
block abstract
sizes abstract
for abstract
random abstract
retrieval abstract
varies, abstract
with abstract
case, abstract
+L+ other
feature abstract
size abstract
and abstract
disk abstract
characteristics. abstract
One abstract
general abstract
observation abstract
is abstract
that abstract
longer abstract
disk abstract
tracks abstract
gives abstract
larger abstract
+L+ other
blocks. abstract
For abstract
line abstract
retrieval abstract
the abstract
optimal abstract
block abstract
size abstract
is abstract
only abstract
depending abstract
on abstract
disk abstract
track abstract
length. abstract
For abstract
other abstract
+L+ other
cases abstract
it abstract
is abstract
also abstract
depending abstract
on abstract
the abstract
feature abstract
size. abstract
For abstract
partly abstract
sequential abstract
retrieval abstract
the abstract
block abstract
size abstract
is abstract
not abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
actual abstract

used abstract
during abstract

the abstract
smallest abstract

and abstract
the abstract
optimal abstract

be abstract

The abstract
analysis abstract
reveals abstract
that abstract
using abstract
too abstract

could abstract
be abstract
very abstract
costly. abstract
The abstract
time abstract
could abstract
easily abstract

double abstract

if abstract

are abstract

In abstract

NIFDY, abstract
a abstract

that abstract
uses abstract

The abstract
+L+ other
basic abstract

NIFDY abstract
is abstract
that abstract

The abstract

We abstract

showing abstract

The abstract
