(combinations abstract

We abstract

a abstract

an abstract

a abstract

We abstract
present abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
for abstract
creating abstract
realistic abstract
synthetic abstract
views abstract
of abstract
existing abstract
architectural abstract
+L+ other
scenes abstract
from abstract
a abstract
sparse abstract
set abstract
of abstract
still abstract
photographs. abstract
Our abstract
approach, abstract
which abstract
combines abstract
both abstract
geometry-based abstract
and abstract
image-based abstract
modeling abstract
and abstract
rendering abstract
techniques, abstract
has abstract
two abstract
components. abstract
The abstract
first abstract
+L+ other
component abstract
is abstract
an abstract
easy-to-use abstract
photogrammetric abstract
modeling abstract
system abstract
which abstract
facilitates abstract
the abstract
recovery abstract
of abstract
a abstract
basic abstract
geometric abstract
model abstract
of abstract
the abstract
photographed abstract
scene. abstract
The abstract
modeling abstract
system abstract
is abstract
effective abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
robust abstract
because abstract
it abstract
exploits abstract
the abstract
constraints abstract
that abstract
are abstract
characteristic abstract
of abstract
architectural abstract
scenes. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
second abstract
component abstract
is abstract
a abstract
model-based abstract
stereo abstract
algorithm, abstract
which abstract
recovers abstract
how abstract
the abstract
real abstract
scene abstract
+L+ other
deviates abstract
from abstract
the abstract
basic abstract
model. abstract
By abstract
making abstract
use abstract
of abstract
the abstract
model, abstract
our abstract
stereo abstract
approach abstract
can abstract
robustly abstract
+L+ other
recover abstract
accurate abstract
depth abstract
from abstract
image abstract
pairs abstract
with abstract
large abstract
baselines. abstract
Consequently, abstract
our abstract
approach abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
model abstract
large abstract
architectural abstract
environments abstract
with abstract
far abstract
fewer abstract
photographs abstract
than abstract
current abstract
image-based abstract
modeling abstract
approaches. abstract
As abstract
an abstract
intermediate abstract
result, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
view-dependent abstract
texture abstract
+L+ other
mapping, abstract
a abstract
method abstract
of abstract
better abstract
simulating abstract

Our abstract
approach abstract

We abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
domain abstract
of abstract
applications abstract
that abstract
can abstract
be abstract
created abstract
with abstract
programming-by-demonstration abstract
+L+ other
(PBD) abstract
can abstract
be abstract
extended abstract
by abstract
improving abstract
the abstract
developers abstract
ability abstract
to abstract
communicate abstract
with abstract
the abstract
system. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
techniques abstract
provided abstract
in abstract
this abstract
thesis abstract
will abstract
allow abstract
nonprogrammers abstract
to abstract
create abstract
a abstract
new abstract
variety abstract
of abstract
complete, abstract
+L+ other
interactive abstract
applications abstract
including abstract
many abstract
board abstract
games abstract
and abstract
educational abstract
software abstract
using abstract
PBD. abstract
+L+ other
A abstract
PBD abstract
software abstract
tool abstract
uses abstract
inferencing abstract
to abstract
induce abstract
programs abstract
by abstract
watching abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
demonstrate abstract
examples abstract
that abstract
show abstract
how abstract
the abstract
application abstract
should abstract
behave. abstract
Current abstract
systems abstract
reduce abstract
their abstract
scope abstract
+L+ other
or abstract
resort abstract
to abstract
having abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
program abstract
because abstract
they abstract
do abstract
not abstract
provide abstract
sufficient abstract
ways abstract
to abstract
express abstract
+L+ other
behaviors abstract
and abstract
the abstract
factors abstract
that abstract
affect abstract
them. abstract
Therefore, abstract
the abstract
goal abstract
of abstract
this abstract
thesis abstract
is abstract
to abstract
develop abstract
understandable abstract
forms abstract
of abstract
annotated abstract
expression abstract
and abstract
manipulation abstract
that abstract
help abstract
a abstract
system abstract
infer abstract
a abstract
broader abstract
range abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
behavior. abstract
To abstract
test abstract
these abstract
ideas, abstract
this abstract
proposal abstract
introduces abstract
a abstract
new abstract
system abstract
called abstract
Gamut abstract
that abstract
will abstract
+L+ other
present abstract
the abstract
techniques abstract
in abstract
a abstract
unified abstract
software abstract
tool. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
first abstract
technique abstract
replaces abstract
the abstract
macro abstract
recorder abstract
method abstract
for abstract
demonstrating abstract
behavior abstract
used abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
other abstract
PBD abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
a abstract
technique abstract
called abstract
nudges. abstract
The abstract
developer abstract
demonstrates abstract
by abstract
correcting abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
system abstract
at abstract
important abstract
points abstract
during abstract
program abstract
execution abstract
and abstract
also abstract
using abstract
two abstract
nudge abstract
commands abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
communicate abstract
important abstract
situations. abstract
First, abstract
the abstract
Do abstract
Something! abstract
nudge abstract
causes abstract
the abstract
system abstract
to abstract
reconsider abstract
+L+ other
past abstract
learned abstract
behavior abstract
and abstract
try abstract
to abstract
generalize abstract
its abstract
knowledge abstract
to abstract
fit abstract
the abstract
current abstract
situation. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
Stop abstract
That! abstract
nudge abstract
will abstract
point abstract
out abstract
improper abstract
behavior abstract
and abstract
generate abstract
negative abstract
examples. abstract
+L+ other
Second, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
use abstract
a abstract
new abstract
deck-of-playing-cards abstract
metaphor abstract
to abstract
express abstract
concepts abstract
such abstract
+L+ other
as abstract
randomness, abstract
sequencing, abstract
and abstract
data abstract
storage. abstract
By abstract
constructing abstract
an abstract
appropriate abstract
deck, abstract
shufing, abstract
sorting, abstract
and abstract
playing abstract
cards abstract
at abstract
key abstract
moments, abstract
developers abstract
can abstract
incorporate abstract
many abstract
effects abstract
not abstract
available abstract
without abstract
programming abstract
in abstract
other abstract
systems. abstract
+L+ other
Third, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
improve abstract
communication abstract
about abstract
behaviors abstract
by abstract
making abstract
them abstract
more abstract
manipulable abstract
than abstract
in abstract
previous abstract
systems. abstract
Behaviors abstract
will abstract
be abstract
represented abstract
as abstract
small abstract
icons abstract
near abstract
the abstract
objects abstract
they abstract
+L+ other
affect. abstract
Using abstract
the abstract
familiar abstract
cut, abstract
copy, abstract
and abstract
paste abstract
commands, abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
can abstract
transfer abstract
behavior abstract
+L+ other
between abstract
objects. abstract
Determining abstract
how abstract
to abstract
make abstract
a abstract
behavior abstract
operate abstract
in abstract
the abstract
new abstract
context abstract
will abstract
be abstract
inferred abstract
+L+ other
automatically. abstract
An abstract
objects abstract
state abstract
from abstract
the abstract
recent abstract
past abstract
will abstract
be abstract
represented abstract
as abstract
temporal abstract
ghosts abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
objects abstract
become abstract
dimmed, abstract
translucent abstract
images. abstract
Many abstract
sorts abstract
of abstract
behavior abstract
refer abstract
to abstract
prior abstract
states abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
as abstract
a abstract
previous abstract
position abstract
or abstract
an abstract
old abstract
property abstract
value. abstract
The abstract
ghost abstract
objects abstract
will abstract
allow abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
make abstract
explicit abstract
connections. abstract
+L+ other
Finally, abstract
to abstract
reduce abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
options abstract
the abstract
system abstract
must abstract
explore, abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
will abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
able abstract
to abstract
give abstract
hints abstract
by abstract
highlighting abstract
important abstract
objects abstract
and abstract
properties. abstract
A abstract
new abstract
inferencing abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
will abstract
be abstract
created abstract
that abstract
will abstract
take abstract
advantage abstract
of abstract
the abstract
hints. abstract
+L+ other
By abstract
combining abstract
these abstract
techniques, abstract
Gamut abstract
will abstract
provide abstract
a abstract
rich abstract
medium abstract
for abstract
expressing abstract
developer abstract
intentions, abstract
fostering abstract
greater abstract
communication abstract
between abstract
the abstract
PBD abstract
system abstract
and abstract
the abstract

The abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
considers abstract
the abstract
use abstract
of abstract
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
+L+ other
within abstract
hard abstract
real-time abstract
systems. abstract
As abstract
the abstract
name abstract
suggests, abstract
+L+ other
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
are abstract
distinguished abstract
by abstract
the abstract
fact abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
they abstract
are abstract
not abstract
locked. abstract
As abstract
such, abstract
they abstract
do abstract
not abstract
give abstract
+L+ other
rise abstract
to abstract
priority abstract
inversions, abstract
a abstract
key abstract
advantage abstract
over abstract
conventional, abstract
lock-based abstract
object-sharing abstract
approaches. abstract
Despite abstract
this abstract
advantage, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
not abstract
immediately abstract
apparent abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
lock-free abstract
shared abstract
objects abstract
can abstract
be abstract
employed abstract
if abstract

+L+ other
must abstract
adhere abstract
to abstract
strict abstract
timing abstract
constraints. abstract
In abstract
particular, abstract
+L+ other
lock-free abstract

concurrent abstract
operations abstract

interferences abstract
can abstract
cause abstract

an abstract

The abstract
main abstract
contribution abstract

this abstract
paper abstract
is abstract
to abstract
show abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
such abstract
interferences abstract
can abstract
be abstract
bounded abstract

This abstract

Based abstract
on abstract
these abstract

it abstract
is abstract

+L+ other
shown abstract
that abstract

Abstract abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
hybrid abstract
method abstract
for abstract
synthesis abstract
of abstract
hierarchical abstract
structured abstract
Petri abstract
nets. abstract
In abstract
a abstract
top-down abstract
manner, abstract
we abstract
decompose abstract
a abstract
system abstract
into abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
subsystems abstract
at abstract
each abstract
level abstract
of abstract
abstraction, abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
these abstract
is abstract
specified abstract
as abstract
a abstract
blackbox abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
that abstract
has abstract
multiple abstract
inputs abstract
and abstract
outputs. abstract
We abstract
stipulate abstract
+L+ other
that abstract
each abstract
subsystem abstract
satisfies abstract
the abstract
following abstract
I/O abstract
constraints: abstract
(1) abstract
At abstract
any abstract
instance abstract
of abstract
time, abstract
at abstract
+L+ other
most abstract
one abstract
of abstract
the abstract
inputs abstract
can abstract
be abstract
activated; abstract
and abstract
(2) abstract
If abstract
one abstract
input abstract
is abstract
activated, abstract
then abstract
the abstract
subsystem abstract
+L+ other
must abstract
consume abstract
the abstract
input abstract
and abstract
produce abstract
exactly abstract
one abstract
output abstract
within abstract
a abstract
finite abstract
length abstract
of abstract
time. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
give abstract
a abstract
stepwise abstract
refinement abstract
procedure abstract
which abstract
starts abstract
from abstract
the abstract
initial abstract
high-level abstract
abstraction abstract
of abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
system abstract
and abstract
expands abstract
an abstract
internal abstract
place abstract
of abstract
a abstract
blackbox abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
into abstract
a abstract
more abstract
detailed abstract
subnet abstract
at abstract
+L+ other
each abstract
step. abstract
By abstract
enforcing abstract
the abstract
I/O abstract
constraints abstract
of abstract
each abstract
subsystem abstract
in abstract
each abstract
intermediate abstract
abstraction, abstract
+L+ other
our abstract
refinement abstract
maintains abstract
the abstract
sequencing abstract
of abstract
transitions abstract
prescribed abstract
by abstract
the abstract
initial abstract
abstraction abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
system. abstract
Next, abstract
for abstract
the abstract
bottom-up abstract
synthesis, abstract
we abstract
present abstract
interconnection abstract
rules abstract
for abstract
sequential, abstract
+L+ other
parallel, abstract
and abstract
loop abstract
structures abstract
and abstract
prove abstract
that abstract
each abstract
rule abstract
maintains abstract
the abstract
I/O abstract
constraints. abstract
Thus, abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
incorporating abstract
these abstract
interconnection abstract
rules abstract
into abstract
our abstract
refinement abstract
formulation, abstract
our abstract
approach abstract
can abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
regarded abstract
as abstract
a abstract
hybrid abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
synthesis abstract
technique abstract
that abstract
employs abstract
both abstract
top-down abstract
and abstract
bottom-up abstract
+L+ other
methods. abstract
The abstract
major abstract
advantage abstract
of abstract
the abstract
method abstract
is abstract
that abstract
the abstract
modeling abstract
details abstract
can abstract
be abstract
introduced abstract
+L+ other
incrementally abstract
and abstract
naturally, abstract
while abstract
the abstract
important abstract
logical abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
resulting abstract
Petri abstract
net abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
guaranteed. abstract

Neural abstract

have abstract
been abstract
successfully abstract
applied abstract
in abstract
a abstract
wide abstract
range abstract

unsupervised abstract
learning abstract
applications. abstract
Neural-network abstract
methods abstract
are abstract
not abstract

+L+ other
tasks, abstract
however, abstract
because abstract
they abstract
often abstract
produce abstract

In abstract
this abstract
article, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
neural-network abstract

that abstract
are abstract
able abstract
to abstract
produce abstract
+L+ other
comprehensible abstract
models, abstract
and abstract
that abstract
do abstract

times. abstract
Specifically, abstract
we abstract
discuss abstract
+L+ other
two abstract
classes abstract
of abstract
approaches abstract
for abstract

with abstract
neural abstract
networks. abstract
The abstract
first abstract
type abstract

approach, abstract
+L+ other
often abstract

rule abstract
extraction, abstract
involves abstract
extracting abstract

+L+ other
The abstract
second abstract
approach abstract
is abstract
to abstract
directly abstract
learn abstract
simple, abstract
easy-to-understand abstract
networks. abstract
We abstract
argue abstract
that, abstract
+L+ other
given abstract
the abstract
current abstract

the abstract

MICE abstract

The abstract
Finite-State abstract
Markov abstract
Channel abstract
(FSMC) abstract
is abstract
a abstract
discrete-time abstract

channel abstract
whose abstract
variation abstract
is abstract
determined abstract
by abstract
a abstract

process. abstract
These abstract
channels abstract
have abstract

due abstract
to abstract
the abstract

Markov abstract

We abstract
obtain abstract
the abstract
FSMC abstract
capacity abstract

We abstract
also abstract
show abstract

We abstract
next abstract
consider abstract
coding abstract

In abstract
general, abstract
the abstract
complexity abstract
of abstract
maximum-likelihood abstract

decoding abstract
grows abstract
exponentially abstract
with abstract
the abstract
channel abstract

length. abstract
Therefore, abstract
in abstract
practice, abstract
interleaving abstract

are abstract
used. abstract
This abstract

We abstract

These abstract

WDM abstract
techniques abstract

The abstract

the abstract

+L+ other

a abstract

Based abstract
upon abstract

the abstract

Although abstract

We abstract
extend abstract

this abstract

three abstract
ways. abstract
First, abstract
we abstract
describe abstract
a abstract
new abstract
+L+ other

based abstract

We abstract
use abstract
this abstract
fact abstract

algorithm abstract
that abstract
traverses abstract
the abstract

We abstract
use abstract

we abstract
show abstract
how abstract

Third, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
a abstract

The abstract

We abstract

However, abstract

In abstract

By abstract
improving abstract

we abstract

On abstract

Our abstract

on abstract

The abstract

In abstract

A abstract
screening abstract

is abstract
a abstract
flat abstract

uses abstract
shallow abstract

analyzing abstract
an abstract

Rather abstract

using abstract
a abstract
deeply abstract
structured abstract
symbolic abstract
analysis, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
use abstract
a abstract
flat abstract
connectionist abstract
analysis. abstract
This abstract
screening abstract
approach abstract
aims abstract
at abstract
supporting abstract

In abstract

we abstract

the abstract

In abstract

a abstract

a abstract

We abstract

that abstract
Hybrid abstract

always abstract
dominates abstract

significantly abstract
outperforms abstract

This abstract
provides abstract

tradeoff abstract
between abstract

Additionally, abstract
our abstract
Hybrid abstract

some abstract

which abstract
can abstract

Recently, abstract
several abstract

A abstract

the abstract

We abstract
argue abstract
that abstract

In abstract

(i) abstract

(ii) abstract
Both abstract

Abstract: abstract
Clustering abstract
is abstract
often abstract
used abstract
for abstract
discovering abstract
structure abstract
in abstract
data. abstract
Clustering abstract
systems abstract
+L+ other
differ abstract
in abstract
the abstract
objective abstract
function abstract
used abstract
to abstract
evaluate abstract
clustering abstract
quality abstract
and abstract
the abstract
control abstract
strategy abstract
+L+ other
used abstract
to abstract
search abstract
the abstract
space abstract
of abstract
clusterings. abstract
Ideally, abstract
the abstract
search abstract
strategy abstract
should abstract
consistently abstract
+L+ other
construct abstract
clusterings abstract
of abstract
high abstract
quality, abstract
but abstract
be abstract
computationally abstract
inexpensive abstract
as abstract
well. abstract
In abstract
general, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
cannot abstract
have abstract
it abstract
both abstract
ways, abstract
but abstract
we abstract
can abstract
partition abstract
the abstract
search abstract
so abstract
that abstract
a abstract
system abstract
inexpensively abstract
+L+ other
constructs abstract
a abstract
`tentative' abstract
clustering abstract
for abstract
initial abstract
examination, abstract
followed abstract
by abstract
iterative abstract
optimization, abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
continues abstract
to abstract
search abstract
in abstract
background abstract
for abstract
improved abstract
clusterings. abstract
Given abstract
this abstract
motivation, abstract
we abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
an abstract
inexpensive abstract
strategy abstract
for abstract
creating abstract
initial abstract
clusterings, abstract
coupled abstract
with abstract
several abstract
control abstract
+L+ other
strategies abstract
for abstract
iterative abstract
optimization, abstract
each abstract
of abstract
which abstract
repeatedly abstract
modifies abstract
an abstract
initial abstract
clustering abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
search abstract
of abstract
a abstract
better abstract
one. abstract
One abstract
of abstract
these abstract
methods abstract
appears abstract
novel abstract
as abstract
an abstract
iterative abstract
optimization abstract
+L+ other
strategy abstract
in abstract
clustering abstract
contexts. abstract
Once abstract
a abstract
clustering abstract
has abstract
been abstract
constructed abstract
it abstract
is abstract
judged abstract
by abstract
+L+ other
analysts abstract
often abstract
according abstract
to abstract
task-specific abstract
criteria. abstract
Several abstract
authors abstract
have abstract
abstracted abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
criteria abstract
and abstract
posited abstract
a abstract
generic abstract
performance abstract
task abstract
akin abstract
to abstract
pattern abstract
completion, abstract
where abstract
the abstract
error abstract
+L+ other
rate abstract
over abstract
completed abstract
patterns abstract
is abstract
used abstract
to abstract
`externally' abstract
judge abstract
clustering abstract
utility. abstract
Given abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
performance abstract
task abstract
we abstract
adapt abstract
resampling-based abstract
pruning abstract
strategies abstract
used abstract
by abstract
supervised abstract
learning abstract
+L+ other
systems abstract
to abstract
the abstract
task abstract
of abstract
simplifying abstract
hierarchical abstract
clusterings, abstract
thus abstract
promising abstract
to abstract
ease abstract
post-clustering abstract
analysis. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
number abstract
of abstract
objective abstract
functions, abstract
based abstract
on abstract
attribute-selection abstract
measures abstract
for abstract
decision-tree abstract
induction, abstract
that abstract
might abstract
perform abstract
well abstract
on abstract
the abstract
error abstract
rate abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
simplicity abstract
dimensions. abstract

This abstract

(NOW) abstract
for abstract
a abstract

Through abstract

our abstract

examines abstract
issues abstract

+L+ other
when abstract
combining abstract
these abstract
two abstract

on abstract
a abstract

Starting abstract
from abstract

NOW abstract

we abstract
incrementally abstract

NOW abstract
for abstract

We abstract
show abstract
that abstract
a abstract

the abstract

(e.g., abstract

have abstract
a abstract

effect abstract
on abstract

We abstract
also abstract
find abstract
that abstract

Furthermore, abstract

Finally, abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
quantify abstract
the abstract

by abstract
keeping abstract

the abstract

When abstract

we abstract
can abstract
still abstract

In abstract

we abstract

Abstract abstract

To abstract
navigate abstract
effectively, abstract
an abstract
autonomous abstract
agent abstract
must abstract
be abstract
+L+ other
able abstract
to abstract
quickly abstract
and abstract
accurately abstract
determine abstract
its abstract
current abstract
+L+ other
location. abstract
Given abstract
an abstract
initial abstract
estimate abstract
of abstract
its abstract
position abstract
(perhaps abstract
based abstract
on abstract
dead-reckoning) abstract
and abstract
an abstract
image abstract
taken abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
known abstract
environment, abstract
our abstract
agent abstract
first abstract
attempts abstract
to abstract
locate abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
landmarks abstract
(real-world abstract
objects abstract
at abstract
known abstract
+L+ other
locations), abstract
then abstract
uses abstract
their abstract
angular abstract
separation abstract
to abstract
obtain abstract
an abstract
improved abstract
estimate abstract
of abstract
its abstract
current abstract
position. abstract
Unfortunately, abstract
some abstract
landmarks abstract
may abstract
not abstract
be abstract
visible, abstract
or abstract
+L+ other
worse, abstract
may abstract
be abstract
confused abstract
with abstract
other abstract
landmarks, abstract
resulting abstract
in abstract
both abstract
time abstract

invisible abstract
landmarks, abstract
and abstract
in abstract
further abstract
errors abstract
in abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
estimate abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
its abstract
position. abstract
To abstract
address abstract
these abstract
problems, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
that abstract
uses abstract
previous abstract
experiences abstract
to abstract
learn abstract
a abstract
selection abstract
function abstract
that, abstract
given abstract
the abstract
set abstract
of abstract
landmarks abstract
that abstract
+L+ other
might abstract
be abstract
visible, abstract
returns abstract
the abstract
subset abstract
which abstract
can abstract
reliably abstract
+L+ other
be abstract
found abstract
correctly, abstract
and abstract
so abstract
provide abstract
an abstract
accurate abstract
registration abstract
of abstract
the abstract
agent's abstract
position. abstract
We abstract
use abstract
statistical abstract
techniques abstract
to abstract
prove abstract
that abstract
the abstract
learned abstract
selection abstract
function abstract
is, abstract
+L+ other
with abstract
high abstract
probability, abstract
effectively abstract
at abstract
a abstract
local abstract
optimal abstract
in abstract
+L+ other

space abstract
of abstract
such abstract
functions. abstract

Several abstract

ABSTRACT abstract

Communication abstract

the abstract
execution abstract

messages. abstract
+L+ other
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
develop abstract
a abstract
scheme abstract
for abstract
providing abstract
predictable abstract
inter-process abstract
communication abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
real-time abstract
systems abstract
with abstract
(partially abstract

point-to-point abstract

networks, abstract
which abstract
+L+ other
provides abstract
guarantees abstract
on abstract
the abstract
maximum abstract
delivery abstract

for abstract
messages. abstract
This abstract
scheme abstract
is abstract
based abstract
on abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
concept abstract
of abstract
a abstract
real-time abstract
channel, abstract
a abstract
unidirectional abstract
connection abstract
between abstract
source abstract
and abstract
destination. abstract
A abstract
+L+ other
real-time abstract
channel abstract
has abstract
parameters abstract
which abstract
describe abstract
the abstract
performance abstract
requirements abstract
of abstract
the abstract
source-destination abstract
communication, abstract
e.g., abstract
from abstract
a abstract
sensor abstract
station abstract
to abstract
a abstract
control abstract
site. abstract
Once abstract
such abstract
a abstract
channel abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
established, abstract
the abstract
communications abstract
subsystem abstract
guarantees abstract
that abstract
these abstract
performance abstract
requirements abstract
+L+ other
will abstract
be abstract
met. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
concentrate abstract
on abstract
methods abstract
to abstract
compute abstract
guarantees abstract
for abstract
the abstract
delivery abstract
time abstract
of abstract
messages abstract
belonging abstract
to abstract
real-time abstract
channels. abstract
We abstract
also abstract

importance abstract
in abstract
the abstract

One abstract
such abstract

is abstract
processor-cache abstract

can abstract
significantly abstract
lower abstract

In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
evaluate abstract
several abstract
aspects abstract
of abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
affinity-based abstract
scheduling abstract
in abstract
multiprocessor abstract
network abstract
+L+ other
protocol abstract
processing, abstract
under abstract
packet-level abstract
and abstract
connection-level abstract
par-allelization abstract
approaches. abstract
Specifically, abstract
we abstract
evaluate abstract
the abstract
performance abstract
+L+ other
of abstract
the abstract
scheduling abstract
technique abstract
1) abstract
when abstract
a abstract
large abstract
number abstract
of abstract
streams abstract
are abstract
+L+ other
concurrently abstract
supported, abstract
2) abstract
when abstract
processing abstract
includes abstract
copying abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
uncached abstract
packet abstract
data, abstract
3) abstract
as abstract
applied abstract
to abstract
send-side abstract
protocol abstract
processing, abstract
and abstract
4) abstract
in abstract
the abstract
presence abstract
of abstract
stream abstract
burstiness abstract
and abstract
source abstract
locality, abstract
two abstract
well-known abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
network abstract
traffic. abstract
We abstract
find abstract
that abstract

conditions, abstract

emphasizing abstract
its abstract
robustness abstract

In abstract

we abstract

which abstract
improves abstract
the abstract

behavior abstract
and abstract
available abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
presents abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
to abstract
describing abstract
+L+ other
group abstract
behavior abstract
using abstract
simple abstract
local abstract

+L+ other
among abstract

We abstract
propose abstract
that abstract
for abstract
a abstract
given abstract

domain abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
basic abstract

can abstract
be abstract
defined abstract
+L+ other
which abstract
describes abstract
a abstract
large abstract

of abstract
group abstract
behaviors. abstract
+L+ other
The abstract
methodology abstract
we abstract
present abstract
allows abstract
for abstract
simplified abstract
+L+ other
qualitative abstract
analysis abstract
of abstract
group abstract
behavior abstract
through abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
use abstract
of abstract
shared abstract
goals, abstract

and abstract
minimal abstract

We abstract
also abstract
demonstrate abstract
how abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
basic abstract
interactions abstract
can abstract
be abstract
simply abstract
combined abstract
into abstract
+L+ other
more abstract
complex abstract
compound abstract
group abstract
behaviors. abstract
+L+ other
To abstract
validate abstract
our abstract
approach abstract
we abstract
implemented abstract
an abstract
array abstract
of abstract
basic abstract
group abstract
behaviors abstract
in abstract
the abstract
domain abstract
of abstract
spatial abstract
interactions abstract
among abstract
homogeneous abstract
agents. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
describe abstract
some abstract
of abstract
the abstract
experimental abstract
results abstract
from abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
distinct abstract
domains: abstract
a abstract
software abstract

and abstract
a abstract

We abstract
also abstract
describe abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
compound abstract
behavior abstract
involving abstract
a abstract
combination abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
basic abstract
interactions. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
compare abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
performance abstract
of abstract
homogeneous abstract

to abstract

of abstract

NP-hard. abstract
However, abstract

there abstract

In abstract

The abstract
multilevel abstract
+L+ other
k-way abstract
partitioning abstract
algorithm abstract
reduces abstract
the abstract
size abstract

the abstract

by abstract
collapsing abstract

(coarsening abstract

finds abstract
+L+ other
a abstract
k-way abstract

then abstract
it abstract
constructs abstract
a abstract

the abstract
original abstract
graph abstract
by abstract
projecting abstract
and abstract
refining abstract
the abstract
partition abstract
to abstract
successively abstract
finer abstract
graphs abstract
(uncoarsening abstract

A abstract
key abstract

of abstract
our abstract
+L+ other

is abstract
that abstract
it abstract
utilizes abstract

Our abstract
algorithm abstract
is abstract
able abstract
to abstract
achieve abstract
a abstract
high abstract
degree abstract
of abstract
concurrency, abstract
while abstract
maintaining abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
high abstract

We abstract
test abstract

For abstract

Recently, abstract
content-based abstract

The abstract

the abstract

content-based abstract
retrieval abstract

have abstract
taken abstract
two abstract
+L+ other
directions. abstract
In abstract
the abstract
first abstract
approach, abstract
image abstract
contents abstract
are abstract
modeled abstract
as abstract
a abstract
set abstract
of abstract
attributes abstract
extracted abstract
manually abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
managed abstract
within abstract
the abstract
framework abstract

conventional abstract
database-management abstract

The abstract
second abstract
approach abstract
depends abstract
+L+ other
on abstract
an abstract
integrated abstract
feature-extraction/object-recognition abstract
subsystem abstract
to abstract
overcome abstract
the abstract
limitations abstract
of abstract
attribute-based abstract
retrieval. abstract
However, abstract
it abstract
has abstract
been abstract
also abstract
stated abstract
that abstract
[GR abstract

topic abstract

both abstract
theoretical abstract
and abstract
practical abstract

Some abstract
recently-proposed abstract

involve abstract
the abstract

designation abstract

network abstract

the abstract
"center" abstract

the abstract

The abstract
choice abstract

this abstract

(which abstract

influences abstract

thus abstract
influences abstract
performance abstract

In abstract
this abstract

we abstract

investigate abstract
the abstract
relationship abstract
between abstract
the abstract
choice abstract

three abstract
performance abstract

Specifically, abstract

We abstract

conclude abstract

that abstract

Optimizing abstract

data abstract
caches abstract
for abstract
parallel abstract
scientific abstract
applications abstract
is abstract
challenging abstract
because abstract
different abstract

+L+ other
exhibit abstract
different abstract
behavior. abstract
Indeed, abstract
while abstract
some abstract
applications abstract
+L+ other
exhibit abstract
good abstract
spatial abstract

others abstract
have abstract
accesses abstract
with abstract
long abstract
+L+ other

Finally, abstract
+L+ other
other abstract

cannot abstract

because abstract
they abstract
exhibit abstract
false abstract

To abstract
help abstract

these abstract
three abstract

efficiently, abstract
we abstract
introduce abstract
the abstract
Pool abstract

a abstract

in abstract

with abstract
the abstract

The abstract

The abstract

Adding abstract

causes abstract

For abstract

the abstract

Finally, abstract

Abstract. abstract
A abstract
critical abstract
challenge abstract
faced abstract
by abstract
the abstract
developer abstract
of abstract
a abstract
software abstract
system abstract
is abstract
to abstract
understand abstract
whether abstract
the abstract
system's abstract
components abstract
correctly abstract
integrate. abstract
While abstract
type abstract
theory abstract
has abstract
provided abstract
substantial abstract
help abstract
in abstract
detecting abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
preventing abstract
errors abstract
in abstract
mismatched abstract
static abstract
properties, abstract
much abstract
work abstract
remains abstract
+L+ other
in abstract
the abstract
area abstract
of abstract
dynamics. abstract
In abstract
particular, abstract
components abstract
make abstract
assumptions abstract
+L+ other
about abstract
their abstract
behavioral abstract
interaction abstract
with abstract
other abstract
components, abstract
but abstract
currently abstract
+L+ other
we abstract
have abstract
only abstract
limited abstract
ways abstract
in abstract
which abstract
to abstract
state abstract
those abstract
assumptions abstract
and abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
analyze abstract
those abstract
assumptions abstract
for abstract
correctness. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
have abstract
begun abstract
to abstract
formulate abstract
a abstract
method abstract
that abstract
addresses abstract
this abstract
problem. abstract
The abstract
+L+ other
method abstract
operates abstract
at abstract
the abstract
architectural abstract
level abstract
so abstract
that abstract
behavioral abstract
integration abstract
+L+ other
errors, abstract
such abstract
as abstract
deadlock, abstract
can abstract
be abstract
revealed abstract
early abstract
in abstract
development. abstract
For abstract
each abstract
+L+ other
component, abstract
a abstract
specification abstract
is abstract
given abstract
both abstract
of abstract
its abstract
own abstract
interaction abstract
behavior abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
of abstract
the abstract
assumptions abstract
that abstract
it abstract
makes abstract
about abstract
the abstract
interaction abstract
behavior abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
external abstract
context abstract
in abstract
which abstract
it abstract
expects abstract
to abstract

This abstract
paper abstract
describes abstract
an abstract
approach abstract
that abstract
integrates abstract
both abstract
paradigms: abstract

Grid-based abstract

As abstract
the abstract
difference abstract
in abstract
speed abstract
between abstract
processor abstract
and abstract
memory abstract
system abstract
continues abstract
to abstract
increase, abstract
it abstract
is abstract
becoming abstract
crucial abstract
to abstract
develop abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
refine abstract
techniques abstract
that abstract
enhance abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
cache abstract
+L+ other
hierarchies. abstract
Two abstract
such abstract
techniques abstract
are abstract
data abstract
prefetching abstract
and abstract
+L+ other
data abstract
forwarding. abstract
With abstract
prefetching, abstract
a abstract
processor abstract
hides abstract
the abstract
latency abstract
of abstract
cache abstract
misses abstract
by abstract
requesting abstract
the abstract
data abstract
before abstract
it abstract
actually abstract
+L+ other
needs abstract
it. abstract
With abstract
forwarding, abstract
a abstract
producer abstract
processor abstract
hides abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
latency abstract
of abstract
communication-induced abstract
cache abstract
misses abstract
in abstract
the abstract
consumer abstract
processors abstract
by abstract
sending abstract
the abstract
data abstract

the abstract
+L+ other
latter. abstract
These abstract
two abstract
techniques abstract
are abstract
complementary abstract
approaches abstract
+L+ other
to abstract
hiding abstract
the abstract
latency abstract

misses. abstract
+L+ other
This abstract
paper abstract
compares abstract
the abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
data abstract
forwarding abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
data abstract
prefetching abstract
to abstract
hide abstract
communication-induced abstract
misses. abstract
+L+ other
Although abstract
both abstract
techniques abstract
require abstract
comparable abstract
hardware abstract
support, abstract
forwarding abstract
usually abstract
has abstract
a abstract
lower abstract
instruction abstract
overhead. abstract
We abstract
+L+ other
evaluate abstract
prefetching abstract
and abstract
forwarding abstract
algorithms abstract
in abstract
a abstract
paralleliz-ing abstract
compiler abstract
using abstract
execution-driven abstract
simulations abstract
of abstract
a abstract
shared-memory abstract
multiprocessor. abstract
Both abstract
data abstract
forwarding abstract
and abstract
prefetch-ing abstract
reduce abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
time abstract
of abstract
applications abstract
significantly abstract
(30-40% abstract
on abstract
average). abstract
Forwarding abstract
performs abstract
better abstract
on abstract
average, abstract
+L+ other
while abstract
prefetching abstract
is abstract
more abstract
robust abstract
to abstract
changes abstract
in abstract
cache abstract
and abstract
memory abstract
parameters. abstract
Finally, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
two abstract
ways abstract
of abstract
integrating abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
two abstract
techniques. abstract
The abstract
integration abstract
of abstract
the abstract
two abstract
techniques abstract
reduces abstract
the abstract
execution abstract
time abstract
even abstract
more abstract
(43-48% abstract
on abstract
average) abstract

One abstract
key abstract
problem abstract
is abstract
how abstract
to abstract
+L+ other
assign abstract
weights abstract
to abstract
attributes abstract
of abstract
cases. abstract
Although abstract
several abstract
+L+ other
weighting abstract
methods abstract
have abstract
been abstract
proposed, abstract
some abstract
methods abstract
cannot abstract
handle abstract
numeric abstract
attributes abstract
directly, abstract
so abstract
it abstract
+L+ other
is abstract
necessary abstract
to abstract
discretize abstract
numeric abstract
values abstract
by abstract
classification. abstract
Furthermore, abstract
existing abstract
methods abstract
have abstract
no abstract
theoretical abstract
background, abstract
so abstract
little abstract
can abstract
be abstract
said abstract
about abstract
optimality. abstract
+L+ other
We abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
new abstract
weighting abstract
method abstract
based abstract
on abstract
a abstract
statistical abstract
technique abstract

Quantification abstract
Method abstract
II. abstract
It abstract
can abstract
+L+ other
handle abstract
both abstract
numeric abstract
and abstract
symbolic abstract
attributes abstract
in abstract
the abstract
+L+ other
same abstract
framework. abstract
Generated abstract
attribute abstract
weights abstract
are abstract
optimal abstract
in abstract
the abstract
sense abstract
that abstract
they abstract
maximize abstract
the abstract
ratio abstract
of abstract
variance abstract
between abstract
classes abstract
to abstract
variance abstract
of abstract
all abstract
cases. abstract
Experiments abstract
on abstract
several abstract

show abstract
that abstract
in abstract
many abstract
+L+ other
cases, abstract
our abstract
method abstract
obtains abstract
higher abstract
accuracies abstract
than abstract
some abstract

methods. abstract
The abstract
results abstract

governed abstract
by abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
and abstract
the abstract
trilinear abstract
+L+ other
tensor. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper abstract
we abstract
unify abstract
both abstract
representations abstract
by abstract
first abstract
re-deriving abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
as abstract
a abstract
rank abstract
+L+ other
deficient abstract
tensor, abstract
and abstract
secondly abstract
by abstract
deriving abstract
a abstract
unified abstract
set abstract
of abstract
operators abstract
that abstract
are abstract
transparent abstract
to abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
+L+ other
views. abstract
As abstract
a abstract
result, abstract
we abstract
show abstract
that abstract
the abstract
basic abstract
building abstract
block abstract
of abstract
the abstract
geometry abstract
of abstract
multiple abstract
views abstract
is abstract
the abstract
trilinear abstract
+L+ other
tensor abstract
of abstract
three abstract
views abstract
and abstract
that abstract
this abstract
tensor abstract
specializes abstract
to abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract
matrix abstract
(in abstract
it's abstract
tensor abstract
form) abstract
in abstract
+L+ other
the abstract
case abstract
of abstract
two abstract
views. abstract
The abstract
properties abstract
of abstract
the abstract
tensor abstract
(geometric abstract
interpretation, abstract
contraction abstract
properties, abstract
+L+ other
etc.) abstract
are abstract
independent abstract
of abstract
the abstract
number abstract
of abstract
views abstract
(two abstract
or abstract
three). abstract
As abstract
a abstract
byproduct, abstract
every abstract
two-view abstract
algorithm abstract
+L+ other
can abstract
be abstract
considered abstract
as abstract
a abstract
degenerate abstract
three-view abstract
algorithm abstract
and abstract
three-view abstract
algorithms abstract
can abstract
work abstract
with abstract
either abstract
+L+ other
two abstract
or abstract
three abstract
images, abstract
all abstract
using abstract
one abstract
standard abstract
set abstract
of abstract
tensor abstract
operations. abstract
To abstract
highlight abstract
the abstract
usefulness abstract
of abstract
this abstract
+L+ other
paradigm abstract
we abstract
provide abstract
two abstract
practical abstract
applications. abstract
First abstract
we abstract
present abstract
a abstract

+L+ other
starts abstract
with abstract
the abstract
fundamental abstract

(in abstract

seamlessly abstract
move abstract
to abstract
the abstract
general abstract
trilinear abstract

all abstract
using abstract

For abstract

Especially abstract
error-prone abstract

are abstract

The abstract

a abstract

typically abstract
depends abstract
on abstract
the abstract

rather abstract

in abstract

in abstract
an abstract

makes abstract
effectiveness abstract

The abstract
effectiveness abstract
of abstract
a abstract

for abstract
object abstract
queries abstract
may abstract
depend abstract
on abstract
the abstract
semantics abstract

functions, abstract
+L+ other

may abstract
vary abstract

Therefore, abstract
optimizers abstract
may abstract
have abstract
to abstract
perform abstract
+L+ other
sophisticated abstract
reasoning abstract
and abstract
apply abstract
transformations abstract

This abstract
thesis abstract
considers abstract
the abstract
correctness abstract

To abstract

correctness, abstract
we abstract
propose abstract
a abstract
formally abstract

two-tiered abstract

(COKO-KOLA) abstract
for abstract
expressing abstract

To abstract

we abstract
propose abstract

logging abstract
is abstract
a abstract
popular abstract
technique abstract

that abstract

Past abstract

the abstract
relative abstract
+L+ other
overhead abstract
imposed abstract
by abstract
pessimistic, abstract
optimistic, abstract
and abstract
causal abstract
protocols abstract
during abstract
failure-free abstract
executions. abstract
In abstract
this abstract
paper, abstract
we abstract
give abstract
the abstract
first abstract
experimental abstract
evaluation abstract
of abstract
the abstract
performance abstract
of abstract
these abstract
+L+ other
protocols abstract
during abstract

We abstract
discover abstract
that, abstract
if abstract
a abstract
single abstract
failure abstract
is abstract
to abstract
be abstract
tolerated, abstract
pessimistic abstract
+L+ other
and abstract
causal abstract
protocols abstract
perform abstract
best, abstract
because abstract
they abstract
avoid abstract
rollbacks abstract
of abstract
correct abstract
processes. abstract
For abstract
+L+ other
multiple abstract
failures, abstract
however, abstract
the abstract
dominant abstract
factor abstract
in abstract
determining abstract
performance abstract
becomes abstract
where abstract
+L+ other
the abstract

information abstract

logged abstract
(i.e. abstract

The abstract

Several abstract
